They're always dying (and usually at the precise moment you wish they wouldn't).\nStill, there are a few ways to delay the \ninevitable death of your phone's battery\n and one is remarkably simple — just get an additional battery and add it to the one you already have. That's the strategy Apple seems to be promoting with its newest product, the \"smart\" battery case for the iPhone 6 and 6s. Apple's new case contains a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that doubles the time you can use your phone before it goes kaput.\nSounds great, right? But there's a problem with Apple's newest product: It's kind of ugly. Gordon Gottsegen at \nWired\n said the case makes it look like the iPhone has a \"strange-looking growth on its backside.\" Lauren Goode at \nThe Verge\n said it looks like an iPod that swallowed an iPhone. But to be fair, Apple's isn't the only battery case that's bulky. As Chris Davies at \nSlash Gear\n pointed out, the popular Mophie Juice Pack Air for iPhone 6 and 6s is just as ungainly as Apple's smart battery case. [\n9 Odd Ways Your Tech Devices May Injure You\n]\nIt seems that, if you want to keep your iPhone looking lean, you'll have to forgo the battery case for now. But are there other ways to \nextend your battery life\n that don't involve adding bulk to your phone? Yes, there is, said Paul Shearing, a chemical engineer at the University College London in the United Kingdom.\nClosing down apps that aren't in use and turning off GPS or Wi-Fi services when you don't need them — these actions are \"remarkably beneficial\" when it comes to conserving battery life, Shearing told Live Science. And there are a few other steps you can take to save your phone's juice, as well.\nYour phone uses a lot of power just keeping your apps up-to-date. Turning off the \"background refresh\" setting on these apps can save you some battery power. The same thing goes for notifications. If you don't need to be notified every time you get a like on a Facebook photo or receive a new email, then disable notifications for these apps. You might notice that your battery drains more slowly as a result, \nPC Mag reports\n. (Both these tricks can be done by going into \"Settings\" on your phone.)\nBut other than these quick power-saving fixes, there's not much you can do to prolong your battery's charge. Though the Internet is awash with advice on how to properly charge your phone to get it to hold a charge for longer, these suggestions are mostly \"bogus,\" said Lloyd Gordon, chief electrical safety officer at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\nFor example, charging your phone in short bursts isn't going to help your battery keep a charge for longer, even though many sites claim this is the case, Gordon told Live Science. It's true that \nLi-ion batteries\n charge more quickly at certain points in the charging process than at others (e.g., charging it when it's 50 percent full may be more efficient than charging it when it's 30 percent full), but trying to plug your phone into the charger at exactly the right time isn’t worth the hassle, said Shearing, who called the difference in charge time \"negligible.\"\nAnd perhaps you've heard the old wives' tale that leaving your phone \nplugged into the charger\n overnight will somehow damage your battery? That isn't true either, according to Shearing.\n\"When the battery is full, it can't accept any more charge,\" Shearing said. Major cellphone manufacturers build \"battery management systems\" into their products to ensure that phone batteries don't charge indefinitely, which would be a serious problem if it were allowed to occur. These systems include a circuit board and accompanying software, which together serve as a sort of mini-computer that regulates your phone's battery.\nThese battery management systems not only ensure that your phone doesn't accept too much charge, they also make sure it doesn't release too much of its charge. Draining a Li-ion battery too much can damage the battery, leading to a \"reduction in lifetime,\" said Shearing, who noted that modern cellphones turn themselves off before the battery drains beyond this point of no return.\nBut while today's cellphone battery management systems are smart, the batteries they manage are still big, bulky and not quite long-lasting enough for many users. This is the problem that companies like Apple are trying to solve with their battery-boosting phone cases.\n\"Even Apple has come to the conclusion that, if you want to have more battery, you're going to have to have a bigger package. And that's because [batteries] are already extremely energy dense. They're working extremely hard already,\" Shearing said.\nIf you're holding out for a cellphone with a super-long battery life, you may be waiting a while longer. Shearing said the next major energy storage breakthrough will likely be the emergence of \nlithium-air batteries\n that \"breathe\" out air as they charge. And air-breathing cellphones probably won't be available for purchase for at least 10 years, he said. So don't hold your breath.\nFollow Elizabeth Palermo @\ntechEpalermo\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "SAN FRANCISCO — Scientists have jury-rigged a microwave oven and a liquid made of food and cosmetics thickener to recreate the Earth's mantle, the mysterious middle layer of the planet.\nThe mock-up mantle could help scientists determine whether a hidden pool of radioactive elements is producing heat deep in \nEarth's interior\n, Angela Limare, a physicist at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris in France, said Tuesday (Dec. 15) here at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.\n\"It looks like the upper mantle is really depleted of radioactive elements,\" Limare said. \"If they are not in the upper mantle, they must be somewhere below.\" [\nIn Photos: Ocean Hidden Beneath Earth's Surface\n]\nMystery mantle\nThe Earth's mantle\n is a molten mass of unanswered questions. The rocky shell between the core and the crust makes up four-fifths of the planet but is the least understood portion. Because it begins anywhere from 5 miles (8 kilometers) to 20 miles (32 km) below the planet's surface and extends about 1,800 miles (2,900 km) below the Earth's surface, scientists can't drill deep enough to determine what it's made of, how the elements in the mantle are distributed or exactly how it moves. Instead, they often use a process called seismic tomography to send seismic waves through the Earth and then analyze their return paths to infer its composition. Volcanologists may also sample the elements in \nmagma from volcanoes that oozes up from mantle plumes\n deep in the Earth, Limare said.\nOne question in particular has long puzzled scientists. The Earth generates about 46 terawatts of heat. Scientists have calculated that about 8 terawatts come from the continental crust floating atop the mantle, while heat generation from the core, which sustains Earth's magnetic field, contributes another 10 to 16 terawatts. This means that about \nhalf of Earth's heat is generated\n by the radioactive decay of elements in the mantle.\nThe trouble is, seismic tomography suggests that, except for the top and bottom of the mantle, \nradioactive elements are sprinkled evenly throughout the mantle\n, and the concentration of those radioactive elements seems to be too low to generate the remaining heat, Limare said. And at the bottom of the mantle, seismic tomography detects two large regions of slow-moving material that must be chemically distinct from the rest of the mantle.  Meanwhile, magma from volcanoes fed by mantle plumes that reach deep into the lowest depths of the mantle can show different chemical compositions, even if the volcanoes are separated by just a handful of miles, she said. Altogether, that suggests there could be material at the innermost layer of the mantle that is very different in composition from the rest of the mantle.\nAs a result, some scientists have proposed that a hidden \nreservoir of radioactive elements\n lurks deep in the mantle and produces the missing heat. If this hidden reservoir exists, it must be very stable and must not be mixing with the rest of the ever-churning mantle, because otherwise, seismic tomography would have detected it, Limare said.\nWith no way to experimentally test this notion, however, geophysicists have been left to hash out their debates in a flurry of models, equations, numerical theories and simulations. [\nPhoto Timeline: How the Earth Formed\n]\nNuke the mantle\nSo, Limare and her colleagues decided take a more hands-on approach. They simulated the mantle using a sheet of cellulose-derived Natrosol that was 11.8 by 11.8 by 2 inches (30 by 30 by 5 cm) thick. At first glance, a small, viscous liquid may seem to have very little in common with 1,800 miles of sandy rock that make up the mantle.\nBut by carefully calibrating some of the properties of the gel — such as its depth, length, viscosity and temperature — the researchers can create a scaled-down model with heat and fluid transport properties very similar to those of the mantle. Limare's team used the Natrosol because it is very easy to vary its viscosity by adding more or less water, while the material can be made denser by sprinkling in salt or.less dense by thinning with alcohol. The material also makes it easy to create two adjacent layers of the \"mantle\" with different properties, she said.\nNext, the scientists mimicked the extremely uniform internal heat generation of radioactive elements inside the mantle. For that, they looked to a ubiquitous household appliance — the microwave oven. \nMicrowaves\n enter and are absorbed by the food, and generate internal heat in the process.\n\"That's how we heat up food; it's exactly the same process,\" Limare told Live Science.\nOf course — do we even need to say it? — don't try this at home! The researchers' microwave may have started out as a commercial oven, but it's been eviscerated and tricked out with sophisticated and high-tech modifications, from liquid crystal thermometers to laser sheets to fancy cameras that operate in two different wavelength ranges.\n\"The only thing left from the commercial stuff is the external box and the door, because the door is very well done,\" Limare said.\nIn the experiment, the boundaries between the Earth's layers are not exactly true to life; the mantle rubs against the molten core and the bottom of the \ncontinental crust\n, but the Natrosol mixture had to be put in a plexiglass container so it wouldn't lie in a puddle at the bottom of the microwave, Limare said.\nNarrowing in on the hidden reservoir\nStill, the model has already provided a few early insights. For instance, when the researchers modeled a mantle with a dense, low-viscosity \"hidden reservoir,\" rivers of heat flowed from the top of the mantle to the bottom. If these rivers of heat reach far enough into the mantle, they would destabilize a hidden reservoir of radioactive elements lurking at the bottom of the mantle. So if a hidden reservoir does exist, it probably wouldn't density, thickness and other characteristics that create a destabilized regime in the mockup mantle, the researchers said.\nThe microwavable mantle is important because it could help scientists narrow the range of conditions that could exist in a hidden reservoir of \nradioactive elements\n, said Gaël Choblet, a planetary interior researcher at the CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) and the University of Nantes in France, who was not involved in the current study.\nThe new technique is novel because it's the first time scientists have produced extremely uniform internal heating in a viscous material that can mimic the mantle, Choblet told Live Science.\nThough the new results on their own are unlikely to solve the mystery of the hidden reservoir, \"it's always very good to compare laboratory experiments and numerical models,\" Choblet said. \"The comparison is usually quite fruitful.\"\nFollow Tia Ghose on \nTwitter\nand \nGoogle+\n. Follow Live Science \n@livescience\n, \nFacebook\n & \nGoogle+\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "'Tis the season of tangled Christmas tree lights, burnt-out menorah bulbs and dried-up mistletoe. But as you deck the halls this year, there's one thing that can keep such decorating nightmares at bay: science. From how to keep a Christmas tree fresh and green to ensuring that festive lights don't interfere with your home's Wi-Fi signal, here are five scientific tips that will help you stress less this holiday season.\n1. Use the right lights\nYou may have heard rumors that holiday lights can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, causing slow Internet connections and, subsequently, a very frustrating holiday. The reasoning behind this seasonal rumor is simple: Wireless networks operate using radio signals, and light bulbs also transmit radio signals, said Tom Coughlin, an electrical engineer and senior member at theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This means, theoretically, the radio signals produced by a whole string of lights could interfere with \nyour Wi-Fi signal\n.\nHowever, the incandescent bulbs and \nlight-emitting diodes (LEDs)\n used on most strandsof modern holiday lights emit low-frequency radio signals and are not likely to cause this problem, Coughlin told Live Science in an email. [\n7 Holiday Stress Busters\n]\nStuart Lipoff, an IEEE fellow, said he agrees with Coughlin. While holiday lights produced decades ago (especially the ones that blinked) may have caused radio interference, today's lights (even the flashing ones) are not likely to emit strong enough radio signals to mess up your wireless network, Lipoff said. So if you're worried that your old lights will ruin your holiday, just buy some new ones and you should be in the clear.\n2. Trim (and water) the tree\nNothing will burst your holiday bubble quite as fast as a house full of prickly tree needles. But there's a scientific way to \nkeep Christmas tree needles on the tree\n and off the floor. All you have to do is water the base of the tree regularly, said Rick Bates, associate professor of horticulture at Pennsylvania State University.\n\"Maintaining a high moisture level in the tree is the single most important factor in reducing needle loss and keeping the tree fresh,\" Bates said on the \nPenn State College of Agricultural Sciences' website\n.\nHow often should you water your tree? Bates recommends replenishing the water-holding tree stand once a day during the first week that the tree is in your home (this is the time period when the fresh-cut tree absorbs the most water). The general rule of thumb is to provide the tree with 1 quart (that's 4 cups, or just less than 1 liter) of water per inch of trunk diameter.\nYou or your local Christmas tree dealer should also make a \"fresh cut\" in the base of the tree before bringing it inside for the holiday season. Re-cutting the stem of the tree just a little — about 0.25 inches or 0.64 centimeters — will help the tree take up more water and, consequentially, keep your tree looking fresh.\n3. Do not knot\nFile this one under \"knot theory.\" Are your Christmas tree lights constantly getting tangled up together in a giant, messy jumble? Believe it or not, there's a scientific explanation for why this happens, and there are even a few practical ways to prevent it from happening.\nIn 2007, physicists from the University of California, San Diego, performed a series of experimentsto figure out why some cords are \nmore likely to tangle than others\n. The scientists found that cords between 1.5 feet and 5 feet (0.46 to 1.5 meters) in length were more likely to knot when they were disturbed or shaken inside of a container than were cords shorter than 1.5 feet. Cords that were longer than 5 feet were just as likely to knot as their shorter counterparts, which is bad news for anyone contending with 25-foot-long (7.6 m) strands of Christmas lights. [\nTech the Holidays with 5 Geeky Holiday Decorations\n]\nThe researchers also found that flexible cords, like the ones that host your holiday lights, are more easily tangled than stiff cords, like electrical wires. The best way to keep your light strands from knotting is to limit their movement, the researchers said. This means wrapping your lights in coils until it's time to decorate. To keep your holiday merry, bright and tangle-free, try wrapping lights around rectangular pieces of cardboard.\n4. Trim those wicks!\nThere's a scientific way to keep your \nHanukkah candles\n burning for eight nights, and all you need to make it happen is a pair of scissors.\nBefore you light the menorah, trim the candlewicks between one-eighth of an inch to one-quarter of an inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm). Trimming the wicks will get the candle's \"combustion process\" off to a good start, \nsaid the National Candle Association\n, a trade association for candle makers in the United States.\nWhen you light a candle, the wax at the base of the wick melts and is drawn up into the wick, where it adds fuel to the burning flame. A long wick causes too much fuel to be burned at once, making the candle's combustion process less efficient. This also causes undesirable side effects, such as a flaring or sooty flame (the soot is made of unburned carbon particles escaping from the flame before they combust). By keeping a candlewick short, you can limit these sooty side-effects and prolong the life of your candles.\n5. Don't wrap anything\nYou won't need any scissors (or wrapping paper, tape or bows) for this next science-inspired tip. Research suggests that beautiful packaging is not the key to giving the perfect gift, which is good news for anyone who feels stressed by the idea of wrapping dozens of presents this holiday season.\nInstead of spending time and money on wrapping paper, try putting some more effort into choosing the right gifts for the people you care about, said Ryan Howell, a psychologist at San Francisco State University and co-founder of beyondthepurchase.org.\nIn a \nrecent interview with Live Science\n, Howell said that a meaningful gift is one that \"shows that you really know the person well, and you really care about them.\" And that might mean finding a gift that you couldn't wrap even if you tried. [\n11 Outdoor Gifts for Exploring Our Amazing Planet\n]\nResearchers from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania have found that people who receive experiential gifts — things like concert tickets or a trip to an art museum — feel more connected to the gift giver than do people who receive material items as gifts. Just think: All that time you spend wrapping could be put toward planning the perfect day on the town with the ones you love.\nFollow Elizabeth Palermo @\ntechEpalermo\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "It was a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup moment in genetic evolution: The end of one gene fused to the beginning of another and, voilà, a new, composite gene was born. In most people the two-component gene does not work. But in a small percentage the gene functions and puts its possessors at increased risk for lupus and potentially other autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues, says a team of researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nIf the Birmingham researchers are right, the gene could be a clue to improving therapy for autoimmune diseases. At least one prominent researcher has roundly criticized the putative lupus link, however.\nIn a paper published December 18 in Science Translational Medicine, the Alabama researchers said that working copies of the fused gene disrupt a tidy feedback loop that the immune system uses to regulate the production of antibodies—molecules that are key players in immune responses to disease-causing microorganisms.\nIn many autoimmune disorders antibodies run amok, targeting not invading microbes, but a person’s organs. Cells known as B lymphocytes, or B cells, secrete the antibodies, and so the B cells make an attractive target for therapies to control autoimmune conditions. Many scientists have focused specifically on manipulating a molecule on B cells that, when bound by antibodies, normally tells the B cells, “Stop! No more antibodies!” In a healthy immune system, activation of this molecule—known as Fc gamma RIIb, or the IIb receptor for short—makes antibody production self-limiting: more antibodies means that more B cells close the antibody tap.\nThe Alabama team found that, when functional, the Reese’s Cup gene causes B cells to manufacture a previously undetected molecule—Fc gamma RIIc. When that molecule is activated by an antibody it countermands the IIb stop order, telling B cells to secrete more antibodies. In people with the fusion gene that encodes the IIc receptor molecule, antibodies are just as likely to engage IIc as IIb and thus induce B cells to overproduce antibodies. \"We believe this is going to change the way people think about feedback and B cells,\" Robert Kimberly, co-author of the Science Translational Medicine paper, told Scientific American in a telephone interview.. \"The way feedback is depicted in the textbook is incomplete.\"\nThe researchers demonstrated the contrarian role of the IIc molecules in studies of both mice and in human and mouse cells in culture. When mice B cells, which don't normally make the IIc molecule, were genetically altered to produce IIc, they generated more antibodies than the B cells of unaltered littermates. Human B cells that had at least one copy of the functioning fusion gene expressed the IIc molecule. Further, the researchers reported, people who carried two copies of the gene that makes IIc had an early immune response to an anthrax vaccine that was two and a half times greater than those without the IIc molecule. Because the vaccine induced antibody production, the rise was another a sign that IIc amps up antibody production. To make the link to IIc and lupus, the researchers compared the genetic profiles of 1,425 people with lupus with the same number without and found that those with the working copies of the IIc-encoding gene had at a 20 percent increased odds of contracting lupus—a risk factor the researchers said was equivalent to other established genetic effects for lupus. “Up until now, it was assumed—going back decades—that there was only a brake on the B cell,” Kimberly says. “But the expression of IIc counterbalances that brake and gives the B cell a feed-forward signal rather than a feedback.”\nHow is it that the fused gene is silent in most people but gives rise to the feed-forward IIc receptor in some? Usually, the Reese’s Cup gene includes three nucleotides—DNA code letters—that serve as a stop sign, preventing the gene from making the IIc receptor molecule. But in 7 to 15 percent of the population a change in a single nucleotide of this stop sign eliminates its inhibitory effect.\nThe receptor was not discovered in B cells before, Kimberly says, because the part of it that lies outside the B cell membrane is identical to the IIb receptor. Only the intracellular part of this membrane-spanning protein, which tells the cell how to respond to antibody binding, differs. This difference explains why antibodies can bind readily to both receptors, but with opposite results.\nBut Jeffrey Ravetch, the Rockefeller University researcher who discovered the existence of Fc receptors and has spent the last several decades characterizing them, says the Science Translational Medicine paper proves nothing. “It’s technically flawed. The conclusions that they draw are not supported by the data they show. It’s lacking controls,” Ravetch told Scientific American in a telephone interview. He criticized nearly every method the researchers used, including the kinds of cells examined in cell-culture studies and the “on switch” the researchers used to activate the genes encoding Fc receptors in laboratory mice as well as the lack of quantitative data showing the amount of gene activity. “If you want to take a swing at the fences, you’d better be prepared to defend yourself,” Ravetch says. “As the authors are well aware, this is a topic for drug development, and those are very important efforts looking at endogenous brakes on the immune system to rein in uncontrolled immune response. If you’re going to take that swing, you want to get it right.”\nKimberly disagrees with Ravetch's objection, saying both the mouse and human data was quantitative, and noted that because mice don't make the IIc receptor, it was impossible to use the mouse's own \"on switch\" to activate the receptor, as Ravetch contends.\nIf the Alabama team’s result holds up, it could, they say, help to explain not only why some people overproduce antibodies that are bad for them, but also why some with autoimmune disorder do not respond to treatments meant to bind to and activate the inhibitory IIb receptors. If the drugs also activate IIc receptors, they could pump up antibody production as much as they dampened it. “There are always patients who don’t respond to any therapy,” says Jeffrey Edberg, a co-author on the paper. “That’s been one of the biggest issues in the field—to try to figure out why some people respond and others don’t.”\nBut whether the work will end up helping people with autoimmune disorders remains an open question. Bassil Dahiyat, president and CEO of Xencor, which has engineered antibodies to interact with the IIb receptor, points out that in studies of patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis the company has so far seen nothing to indicate that its engineered antibodies are causing B cells to make more antibodies. Rather, across the board, they see strong B cell suppression, he notes.\nStill, if IIc receptor does play a role in B cell antibody production, then testing for its activity could potentially help Xencor and other gene therapy companies that are targeting B cells determine the best candidates for treatment with their products.\n“Wouldn’t it be fantastic if we could see which patients would respond to different drugs?” Dahiyat says. That would be an important tool, he adds. “It’s fantastic to see these pieces come together.”\nFollow \nScientific American\n on Twitter \n@SciAm\n and \n@SciamBlogs\n.\nVisit \nScientificAmerican.com\n for the latest in science, health and technology news.\n© 2014 \nScientificAmerican.com\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "There's a secret to making panda babies, and it looks a little bit like love.\nPandas are more likely to produce young when they have a preference for the partner they're meant to mate with, a new study finds. If \"love\" is too strong a word for this preference, it's safe to say that \npanda\n lust, at least, plays a role in reproductive success.\nIn a new study published Tuesday (Dec. 15) in the \njournal Nature Communications\n, researchers allowed pandas to \npick their own mates\n by letting them observe a pair of opposite-sex bears through barriers in a special enclosure. Bears showed their romantic interest by making chirping noises and scent-marking near their preferred partner.\nThis freedom of choice turned out to have a major effect on the likelihood of pandas reproducing. Overall, mutual attraction raised the rates of successful mating and cub-rearing from around zero percent when the two bears weren't interested in one another to 75 percent when they were both attracted. [\nPhotos: A Panda Cub Grows Up\n]\nData broken down by gender illustrates the effect. When a female was paired for mating purposes with a male she preferred, the pair had successful sex 70 percent of the time, compared with only about 30 percent of the time when fertile females were placed with a male they weren't interested in. Females gave birth to a cub 90 percent of the time when a preferred male was the father versus 40 percent of the time when they mated with a non-preferred male. And 100 percent of pandas who copulated with a preferred male cared for their offspring, a number that dropped to 80 percent in pandas whose offspring were fathered by unappealing mates.\nMale choice mattered, too — a surprising finding, given that females that do all the gestation and rearing are generally thought to be pickier than males who invest less of themselves. But panda males invest considerable time and energy in wooing females in the wild and fending off rival males, researcher Meghan Martin-Wintle of the Institute for Conservation Research, San Diego Zoo Global and PDXWildlife in Portland and her colleagues wrote. Thus, they have to be \nchoosy about which female pandas they pursue\n.\nWhen males got busy with a preferred female, they completed the sex act more than 70 percent of the time, compared with only about 30 percent of the time when mating with an unappealing female. Mating resulted in cubs almost 80 percent of the time when males picked a female they liked, but only 60 percent of the time when they had to mate with a non-preferred partner. And panda moms seemed influenced by whether the male had seen them as a good match: When males mated with a preferred partner, that female reared her cub more than 90 percent of the time. When the male fathered a cub with a female he didn't prefer, the likelihood of maternal care dropped to less than 70 percent.\nOverall, the researchers found, mutual attraction can improve panda reproduction. Giving pandas free reign over their mate choices, however, may be tougher than it sounds. Conservation breeders have to be careful to ensure genetic variability in \nendangered species like pandas\n, which are few in number. But if breeders were to pre-screen bears for genetic diversity and then check in on how the pandas respond to one another, that would allow for \"the best of both worlds,\" Martin-Wintle and her colleagues wrote.\nThe research was conducted at the Bifengxia Chinese Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan, China. China is working to reintroduce pandas into the wild, a goal that will require breeding more pandas than in the past. To meet this goal, the researchers wrote, biologists will need a better of understanding of how pandas reproduce on their own in the wild.\nFollow Stephanie Pappas on \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n.

This death of CD4+ T cells over the ensuing years leads to progressive immune deficiency, and thus AIDS.\nHIV-1 particles assembling at the surface of an infected macrophage\nIn AIDS, the loss of CD4+ T cells – and the immunological disarray this creates – renders people with HIV susceptible to opportunistic infections otherwise unknown in those with healthy immunity. Without treatment, a third of AIDS patients develop pneumonia from a ubiquitous fungus called Pneumocystis. The virus cytomegalovirus leads to the development of blind spots and then complete blindness in one eye before savaging the sight of the other eye. Inflamed pockets of brain infection by the cat parasite Toxoplasma gondii cause focal weakness and other neurological defects.\nThese and other cardinal manifestations of AIDS have been known \nsince 1981\n when doctors first reported new and perplexing cases of opportunistic infections among gay men in the coastal United States. What has eluded full explication until recently is how HIV infection causes this progressive death of CD4+ T cells.\nOne reasonable assumption early on would have been that HIV caused the death of CD4+ T cells via direct infection of CD4+ T cells. Many viruses like influenza and poliovirus cause \nlysis\n of their human host cells either through direct viral toxicity or mediated by vigorous host immune efforts to kill infected cells.\nYet a conundrum emerged early in the effort to understand AIDS pathogenesis: only a minority of CD4+ T cells are actively infected by HIV – usually fewer than five percent – so why did so many CD4+ T cells die if so few were actively infected?\nUntil recently, the best explanation for this paradoxical finding was that \nchronic immune activation\n associated with HIV infection was killing CD4+ T cells. It was already known that unquenched HIV infection is accompanied by chronic immune activation in which an unending flurry of cytokine release stimulates cellular proliferation and antibody production. During this process, wave after wave of immune cells are recruited to fight HIV, but all fail. Instead HIV rages on in lymph nodes and in the blood, calling forth still further waves of immune cells in an ultimately futile and ever-weaker attempt to contain HIV infection. The perpetual recruitment of immune cells into an ultimately futile fight against a ravaging virus – augmented by bloodstream leakage of pro-inflammatory bacterial products past the damaged gut immunological barrier – came with a huge cost: wave after wave of CD4+ T cell death.\nThe massive losses of vital CD4+ T cell defenders against the HIV invasion appeared, at least early on, to result from a coopted normal immunological housekeeping mechanism: \napoptosis\n. Apoptosis is programmed death of cells whose utility has waned. Imagine contracting an upper respiratory tract infection from a rhinovirus or some other cause of the common cold. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and other immune cells migrate to the mucosal lining of the sinuses and other airway tissues to eliminate this rhinoviral invader, getting killed in the process of pitched immunological battle and as a result being extruded from the body in the form of snot. In a few days, the rhinoviral invader has been repelled, and the utility of these cellular defenders comes to an end unless a lifelong runny nose is desired. The most expeditious way to extinguish the immunological fire, then, is via activation-induced cell death, in which responder immune cells are preprogrammed to undergo apoptosis, thus clearing the mucosal battlefield and making way for good health to return. AIDS pathogenesis was felt to hijack this normal process because wave after wave of ineffectual CD4+ T cell responses to HIV infection would lead to CD4+ T cell apoptosis followed by recruitment of new CD4+ T cells which in turn would die, and so on.\nEnter Warner Greene, a dapper white-haired professor of medicine at UCSF and its Gladstone Institute of Virology. In a feat of scientific hutzpah sure to trigger fits of envy among other scientific heavy-hitters, Greene shattered the existing model of AIDS pathogenesis in two simultaneous groundbreaking articles in the prestigious journals \nScience\n and \nNature\n in late December 2013.\nGreene’s team made multiple seminal observations. Their key findings were:\nAbortive infection of CD4+ T cells by HIV virions – in which HIV enters the CD4+ T cell cytosol but then accumulates incomplete viral transcripts which cannot establish a productive replication cycle – is detected by a host DNA sensor called interferon-gamma-inducible protein 16, or IFI16;\nIFI16 (and potentially other sensors of abortive HIV infection) triggers an intense inflammatory process of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis, known as pyroptosis;\nPyroptosis leads to release of intracellular contents as well as inflammatory cytokines into the extracellular milieu thus plausibly contributing to chronic immune activation;\nThe pyroptosis caused by widespread abortive HIV infection of CD4+ T cells is mediated in part by the intracellular enzyme caspase-1; and,\nPharmaceutical blockade of caspase-1 safely precluded HIV-mediated pyroptosis of CD4+ T cells.\nAnd thus our model of AIDS pathogenesis is revised once again. While clearly chronic immune activation contributes to the loss of CD4+ T cells and AIDS pathogenesis, Greene and colleagues explain this process in an entirely novel way. Instead of chronic immune activation serving in a leading role during AIDS pathogenesis, chronic immune activation is recast in a supporting role, becoming itself a bystander to the real culprit, abortive HIV infection of CD4+ T cells.\nThese findings topple our conception of how HIV causes death among millions each year. They also have concrete clinical import. By demonstrating that caspase-1 inhibitors can block pyroptosis and thus a critical step in AIDS pathogenesis, Greene and colleagues breathe new life into the global effort to fight AIDS. Modern \nanti-HIV therapy\n has restored decades of life to the millions who can access it, but despite these successes current anti-HIV treatments do not wholly rectify chronic immune activation, restore full immunological function nor stave off all of the non-infectious risks of HIV infection such as cancer. Greene and collaborators recently \nannounced\n a phase II human clinical trial testing the safety and potency of caspase-1 inhibitors in precluding HIV-associated pyroptosis. If safe, targeting capsase-1 mediated CD4+ T cell pyroptosis could help delay expensive anti-HIV therapy and/or augment anti-HIV therapy-mediated protection from the clinical manifestations of HIV and AIDS.\nNearly 33 years after clinicians first reported AIDS, we are still learning how HIV kills. The novel identification of a major role of pyroptosis in AIDS pathogenesis suggests novel therapeutic pathways and thus new hope in the fight against HIV.\nPhoto credit: Gross L (2006) Reconfirming the Traditional Model of HIV Particle Assembly.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "Imagine walking into a store, running on a treadmill for a few minutes and then purchasing a pair of shoes tailored precisely to the contours of your feet. That's the future of sneaker buying, according to Adidas.\nThe shoe and clothing company recently unveiled its Futurecraft 3D sneaker — a running shoe with a 3D-printed midsole (the part between the inner sole that touches your foot and the outer sole that touches the ground). Adidas said the midsole can be tailored to fit the \"cushioning needs\" of your feet, whatever those may be.\nTo get the measurements needed to 3D print a custom shoe part, sneaker lovers will first have to run on a specially equipped treadmill. Embedded with foot-scanning technologies, the treadmill track will relay information to a computer that creates a design for the personalized midsole. The design file can then be sent to a 3D printer and, voilà — you get a custom-made pair of running shoes that matches the \"exact contours and pressure points\" of your feet, according to Adidas. [\nThe 10 Weirdest Things Created by 3D Printing\n]\nAdidas showed off its new product in a recent YouTube video, which gives an up-close view of \nselective laser sintering\n, or SLS, the 3D printing process used to create the shoe. In SLS, a laser fuses together powdered materials — in this case, thermoplastic polyurethane, or TPU — to form a solid object. The fused-together midsole rises like a phoenix from the bed of powder. Then, it's dusted off and enclosed in a sneaker. Adidas worked with the 3D-printing company Materialise to refine the process.\nThough the 3D-printed sneakers in Adidas' video are made for runners, the new manufacturing technique can \"meet the needs of any athlete,\" Eric Liedtke, executive board member at Adidas, \nsaid in a statement\n.\nAnd it's a good thing Adidas is looking to expand upon this technology, because one of its toughest competitors is already making 3D-printed shoes for nonrunners: Nike unveiled its \nVapor Ultimate football cleat\n last year, which is made using both 3D printing and another digital manufacturing process — 3D knitting. In 3D knitting, a machine turns a computer file into a seamless article of clothing or, in Nike's case, a seamless shoe that fits the wearer like a sock.\nOther shoe brands are also using 3D printing to create custom kicks for everyday wear. \nUnited Nude\n, a British design company, makes some pretty futuristic-looking high heels using 3D printing.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "How do you keep a demon from disturbing the living? A blade to the throat should do the trick.\nA few skeletons unearthed in a 400-year-old Polish cemetery have been discovered with sickles placed around their necks. Archaeologists believe this strange burial practice is evidence of a belief in magic and a fear of demons.\nThe sickle burials were found at Drawsko cemetery, a site in northeastern Poland that dates from the 17th to the 18th centuries. Archaeologists, including Marek Polcyn, a visiting scholar at Lakehead University in Canada, have excavated more than 250 graves there since 2008.\nAmong those graves were four skeletons with sickles placed at their throats, and a fifth skeleton with a sickle placed over its hips. Previously, these burials had been \ndescribed as \"vampire\" burials\n, with the sickles interpreted as a way to prevent the dead from reanimating and terrorizing the living. But in a new study detailed in the journal \nAntiquity\n, Polcyn and co-author Elzbieta Gajda, of the Muzeum Ziemi Czarnkowskiej, now reject that characterization. (\"We deliberately dismiss the interpretation of a revenant (i.e. vampire),\" isn't something you read in an academic paper every day.) [\nSee Photos of the Sickle Burials at Drawsko Cemetery\n]\nInstead, the archaeologists prefer to use the blanket term \"anti-demonic\" to talk about these burials, partly because \nvampires\n weren't the only kinds of evil incarnations of the dead, according to traditional folk beliefs in the region. But also, the sickle graves were afforded funerary privileges that weren't usually extended to \n\"vampires\" buried elsewhere\n: They were given Christian burials in sacred ground alongside other members of the community, and their corpses do not appear to have been desecrated or mutilated.\nIn another sign that the people buried with sickles probably were not outsiders, scientists who studied chemical signatures locked in the teeth of these corpses found that all five individuals were locals. (They published those results in a \npaper in PLOS ONE\n last year.)\n\"The magical and ritual meaning of this gesture seems beyond doubt,\" Polcyn and Gajda wrote, adding, however, that the sickle might have had more than one ritualistic meaning. The tool may have been intended to keep the dead in their graves under the threat of cutting their throat, but it also might have been used to prevent evil forces from tormenting their souls. What's more, the use of a tool made of iron, which had to undergo a transformation in fire, could symbolize the passage from life to death, the authors wrote. [\n7 Strange Ways Humans Act Like Vampires\n]\nEven though Christianity was the dominant religion in Poland at the time this cemetery was used, traditions from old Slavic pagan faith and folk belief systems still existed, including a belief in \ndemons\n. Besides the sickles, there is not much that makes these graves unique, so the scientists aren't sure exactly what about these people made them demonic. They may have been thought to have supernatural powers in life, or they might have had physical characteristics considered suspicious (which might have included \"an exceptionally hairy body,\" a unibrow, a large head and a red complexion, the authors said, citing traditional Polish folklore).\nThese people also might have died in a traumatic fashion, without any time for the appropriate rites and rituals to make for a smooth spiritual transition into death — a concept some archaeologists call a \"bad death.\" While some of the people buried with sickles may have simply died of old age, one of them, a girl, died as a teenager. The authors speculated that she might have met a violent and untimely end, perhaps through drowning, suicide or murder. Unfortunately for archaeologists, however, this death didn't leave its mark on the girl's bones.\nPolcyn and Gajda wrote that they hope further scientific tests on the corpses, such as biomolecular analyses, will help them understand more specifically what led the dead in Drawsko to be buried with sickles.\nFollow us \n@livescience\n, \nFacebook\n & \nGoogle+\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "The bizarre rigid \"sail\" on the back of a newfound species of herbivorous dinosaur may have helped the paleo-beast survive in a variety of climates, a new study finds.\nThe dinosaur lived during the Early Cretaceous period about 125 million years ago in ancient Spain, the researchers said. During that time, some areas of Iberia had alternating wet and dry periods. Perhaps the dinosaur used its sail to regulate its body temperature, much like an elephant uses its large ears to release excess body heat, the researchers said.\nOr, the dinosaur could have used the sail as a place to store fat to use when resources were scarce, the scientists said. [\nPaleo-Art: Dinosaurs Come to Life in Stunning Illustrations\n]\nThe dinosaur remains were discovered in May 2013 in a quarry near the city of Morella in northeastern Spain, said study co-author Fernando Escaso, an assistant professor for the Evolutionary Biology Group at the National Distance Education University in Madrid, Spain. Since then, Escaso and his colleagues have been excavating and examining the bones.\nThe researchers named the new species Morelladon beltrani, for the city where it was discovered and \"odon,\" the Greek word for \"tooth.\" (The dinosaur's teeth are similar in shape, but not size, to those of modern iguanas, Escaso said.) The species name honors Vi?ctor Beltra?n, for his help uncovering other fossils at the Mas de la Parreta quarry, the researchers said.\nAn analysis showed that M. beltrani measured 20 feet (6 meters) long from head to tail, and stood 8.2 feet (2.5 m) high at its shouldersThat makes the beast similar in size to its relative Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, also known from the \nEarly Cretaceous\n of ancient Europe, the researchers said.\nM. beltrani's most defining feature is the sail, formed by tall, boney spines that attach to the vertebrae on the animal's back. The spikes were tall, measuring up to 12 inches (31 centimeters) long, according to the fossils.\nIf the dinosaur migrated, using the sail as a storage place for fat would have come in handy, Escaso said. There is no direct evidence that M. beltrani \nmigrated\n, but fossil discoveries show that other dinosaurs from the Mas de la Parreta quarry lived in herds. Moreover, large modern herbivores such as elephants that live in herds also migrate, Escaso said.\nThe study was published online today (Dec. 16) in the \njournal PLOS ONE\n.\nFollow Laura Geggel on Twitter \n@LauraGeggel\n.

And with \"Star Wars\" mania hitting a peak right now, what better way to get in your exercise than with a lightsaber workout?\nLightsaber-themed fitness classes are popping up across the country, from New York City to Honolulu.\nAnd these classes are more than just an opportunity to practice your sparring skills using a realistic-looking lightsaber — they're also a great workout.  [\nSecrets of the Jedi Lightsaber (Infographic)\n]\nWorking out with a lightsaber involves a mix of \ncardio\n and body-weight conditioning, said Keith Mylett, who started one of these saber-themed fitness classes at the Hawaii Jedi Saber Academy (part of a gym called Precision Parkour) in Honolulu.\nIn New York, classes are offered at the New York Jedi fitness studio. Meanwhile, at some locations of the East Coast sports club chain that includes New York Sports Club, Boston Sports Club and Washington Sports Club, a class called \"Awaken Your Inner Force\" is offered. In San Diego and other California cities, a Meetup group called the Lightsaber Team gets together for \"Star Wars\"-themed exercise.\nIn the Hawaii class, the students are sweating and smiling by the end, Mylett told Live Science. It gets your heart rate up, he said.\nThe workout — which is similar to any type of martial arts training involving staffs, swords or sticks —targets the muscles in the upper body, Mylett said.\nThe toy lightsabers used in his class weigh 3 to 5 lbs. (1.4 to 2.3 kilograms), he said. \"When held at arms length for nearly an hour straight, there is definitely some burn in the arms, back and shoulders,\" he said. There are also some benefits to your core and legs from holding a \"strong, mindful stance\" for an extended period of time, he added.\nThe workouts were designed by watching fight scenes from the movies and applying those movements to sword basics and easy-to-learn \"blade on blade\" fight choreography, Mylett said. \nEach class begins by warming up the arms and wrists. Then, the students are taught some basic lightsaber movements, focusing on proper form, aim, speed and power, Mylett said. Next, the instructors teach the choreography of the workout using a number system so students can remember the moves before partnering up to practice, he said.\nEach class ends with a short \nmeditation\n on the Force.\nMylett has his \"padawans,\" or Jedi trainees, start out using a 36-inch lightsaber blade and a two-handed grip. \"This is to emphasize safety and control — two hands can more easily stop a blade,\" he said.\nThe two-handed beginner technique is called \"Shii Cho\" and is \"perfect for padawans\" and \"taking out a battalion of \nbattle droids\n,\" Mylett said.\nMore advanced Jedi fighters then learn the Makashi style, which uses lighter-weight lightsabers that allow for one-handed attacks, he said. This form is \"perfect for battling a Sith Lord one on one,\" Mylett said.\nAnd for the Jedi master, there's the Soresu style, a more defensive form with \"lots of flair,\" in which Jedi create arcs to defend the body, he said. \"Perfect for deflecting blaster fire,\" he said.\nFor those interested in sparring at home, a 1-inch PVC pipe cut to between 3 and 4 feet (0.9 and 1.2 meters) could work as a make-shift lightsaber, Mylett said. But using anything that weighs more could potentially be dangerous, he said.  (Even moving at 50 percent speed, there's still a chance you could get whacked, he added.)\nBut for padawans and Jedi alike, \na bright LED\n to simulate the lightsaber \"really adds fun, excitement and that geek factor that makes saber dueling so awesome,\" Mylett said. \nFollow Sara G.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "Australia's blue-banded bee is a successful pollinator because it uses its head — literally, scientists have found.\nLike a heavy-metal fan headbanging to Iron Maiden, this species of blue-banded bee (Amegilla murrayensis) vibrates its head rapidly when visiting flowers. This turns out to be quite an effective method for distributing pollen, the researchers found. \nAs the bee's common name suggests, its abdomen is banded by metallic blue stripes, strikingly different from the yellow and black stripes usually found on honeybees. Native to Australia, blue-banded bees are solitary, with females building individual burrows in soil or clay. [\nVideo: Headbanging Bee Puts Metal Heads to Shame\n]\nGetting a buzz\nBlue-banded bees, like many other bee species, are known as \"buzz-pollinators.\" To pollinate a flower, these bees were thought to use their mandibles to grasp the part of the stamen that contains the pollen, and shake the pollen loose by vibrating their flight muscles. This type of pollination is necessary for plants that hold their pollen in a capsule, such as \ntomato plants\n.\nThe researchers combined several techniques, including audio recordings and high-speed video, to compare the native blue-banded bees' tomato-pollinating prowess with another species commonly used in Australia for pollinating tomato plants, the North American \nbumblebee\n (Bombus impatiens).\nWhen the scientists listened to audio recordings of the bees, they found that A. murrayensis buzzed at higher frequencies than the bumblebees. They also noticed that the blue-banded bee spent less time at every flower than the bumblebee, and typically visited each flower only once.\nHeadbangers' ball\nBut the most telling difference was revealed on video: nine clips of pollinating bees recorded at 2,000 frames per second. Instead of clutching the flower's stamen and shaking it to release the \npollen\n, A. murrayensis was doing something completely unique. The bee would rapidly \"bang\" its head against the pollen cone at a very high rate of speed, calculated by the scientists to be 350 times per second. \nThe scientists were \"absolutely surprised,\" study co-author Sridhar Ravi, a research fellow at the School of Aerospace, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Engineering at RMIT University in Australia, said in a statement. None of them had ever observed this type of behavior before. \"This is something totally new,\" Ravi said.\nThere were clear benefits to this unusual approach, the researchers reported. The higher frequency of the headbanging vibration would not only work well to break up clumps of wet pollen, but could also dislodge more pollen overall, which would explain why the bees' \nflower visits\n were shorter, and why they only visited once.\nAccording to a statement by study co-author Katja Hogendoorn, a bee specialist with the School of Agriculture, Food and Wine at the University of Adelaide, previous research had already demonstrated that the blue-banded bees were effective pollinators. Now, knowing that they needed less time per flower suggests that the headbanging bees would also be very efficient pollinators, Hogendoorn said.\nThe findings were published online Dec. 1 in the journal \nArthropod-Plant Interactions\n.\nFollow Mindy Weisberger on \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "SAN FRANCISCO — The world's leaders should institute a carbon tax to mitigate the worst effects of climate change and help shift the global economy away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said.\nThe current lack of a \ncarbon tax\n amounts to a hidden subsidy that incentivizes \"bad behavior,\" Musk said here Tuesday (Dec. 15) at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).\n\"It's kind of like if we had high taxes on fruits and vegetables and low taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,\" said \nMusk\n, the founder and CEO of the private spaceflight company SpaceX. \"That wouldn't make sense, but that's sort of what we have now with respect to energy, with very powerful forces trying to keep it that way.\" [\nEarth in the Balance: 7 Crucial Tipping Points\n]\nAt heart, prices are just a form of information that \"tell people what to do, and what things should be favored over another thing. And so when the prices are wrong, then the wrong thing happens in the economy,\" he added. \"Any sort of carbon tax would reduce the effective error in the system of prices in the economy.\"\nMusk is working to reduce humanity's dependence on gas, oil and coal, which release heat-trapping \ncarbon dioxide\n (CO2) into the atmosphere when burned. Musk co-founded and helms the electric-car company Tesla Motors, and he also co-founded and serves as chairman of SolarCity, the United States' largest solar-power provider.\nNot surprisingly, Musk is bullish on solar, viewing it as the chief energy source of the post-fossil-fuels future.\n\"You could take basically a corner of Utah and Nevada and power the whole United States with solar power,\" Musk said. \"So I think that's mostly how it will get solved.\"\nAnd that future dependency on renewable energy — with solar in the lead, but also featuring hydropower, nuclear energy and other \"green\" sources — cannot come soon enough, Musk said.\nHumanity will need to shift to a sustainable-energy economy at some point, because the world's accessible fossil fuels won't last forever, he noted.\n\"The question is just when [the shift occurs], and how many billions of tons of CO2 are in the atmosphere versus in the ground,\" Musk said. \"Given that we know where we'll end up, which is a sustainable-energy economy, it seems like we should terminate this experiment as soon as possible.\"\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter \n@michaeldwall\n and \nGoogle+\n. Follow Live Science \n@livescience\n, \nFacebook\n & \nGoogle+\n.

She is the author of \"\nDesign the Life You Love: A Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Meaningful Future\n\" (Ten Speed Press, 2015). Ten Speed Press is an imprint of Penguin Random House. More on Ayse Birsel at www.aysebirsel.com and on Twitter, @aysebirselseck. She contributed this article to Live Science's \nExpert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights\n.\nThis fall I read \"\nThe Martian\n\" (Crown, 2014) by Andy Weir, and it made me want to be a scientist. I was drawn to Mark Watney, the main character, by his optimism, creativity and problem solving — which he maintained even in the face of the most dire conditions (it doesn't get any more dire than being left alone on Mars!). \nIt's because I share those three traits — optimism, creativity and problem solving — that I'm a product designer. But while science is about explaining the world and universe based on facts, my field is about imagining the world based on possibilities. Designers look at everyday products, services and experiences in new ways, and design to improve life. In doing so, we tag-team with engineers, who are indispensable to making our designs manufacturable and real.\nDesign for life\nIn my career, I've designed hundreds of products, from toilet seats to office systems to kitchen gadgets to pens. Some of my designs you might have already used, such as a potato peeler for Giada's collection at Target to the Herman Miller Resolve Office System you may be sitting in as you read this article. \nEven though the products vary greatly, the red thread across all of them is my design process — Deconstruction:Reconstruction. It helps me, and those around me, think differently and bring new solutions to old problems. Even problems in life.\n\"\nDesign the Life You Love\n\" started as an experiment. I think that people's lives are their biggest design projects — full of constraints, challenges, and opposing needs and wants — and I wanted to see if I could apply my process and tools to living. You simply cannot have everything. If you want to have more, you need to make what you want and what you need co-exist. This requires that you think like a designer.\nI fell in love with the human scale of design when I was 16. A family friend came to tea and asked me if I knew what product design was. I didn't. Using a teacup, he explained to me that the edge of the cup is curved to better fit people's lips, the handle is to help people hold hot liquid in their hands and the saucer is there so that if I spilled some of my tea, I wouldn't ruin my mom's tablecloth. \nDesign 101 for scientists\nSince I often work closely with engineers, I've come to realize that the design process has uncanny similarity to the scientific and engineering processes, yet it differs in key ways. By understanding the design process I use, everyone, including scientists, can gain insight into solving complex problems that they might want to think differently about … including how to live a complete life.\nHere are a few simple steps to help you tackle challenges like a designer:\n00. Warm up:\nDraw something to warm up your right brain (if you wonder about the difference between the right and left brains, here is a great \narticle\n). You might say as a scientist that you don't draw. Come on! Everyone draws. It doesn't have to be masterpiece. Just rest your eyes on something — a flower, a mug, a cat or a person (you can use the template below if you're drawing a person) and draw for 3 minutes. There, now you just sent a signal to your brain that you're going to think creatively. [\nThe Roots of Creativity Found in the Brain\n ]\n01. Deconstruction:\nDeconstruction is breaking the whole apart to see what it's made of. You can even deconstruct something very familiar, like science, to see what goes into it. Here is my deconstruction of science across the four quadrants of emotion, physical reality, intellect and spirit (the four quadrants tool is one I use to think holistically).\n02. Point of View:\nPeople can shift their points of view intentionally. As this beloved Shakespeare quote says, \"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" In design, you want to shift from what you know to what you can imagine. I have gathered a couple of tools over time to help shift my perspective from what I know to what I can imagine. My favorite is the metaphor. You can use metaphors to help think about difficult subjects through the lens of something you know. One of my favorite STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) projects is STEAM Carnival by Two Bit Circus, which uses the metaphor of a traveling, high-tech carnival to teach people, young and old, about science. Imagine being inside the Dunk Tank Flambé, which spouts out flames instead of water when a player hits the target with a softball, engulfing in this case my friend John Zapolski in fire. Luckily for John, he is wearing a super-flame-retardant suit. Image is courtesy of photodepot.com and Two Bit Circus.\n03. Reconstruction:\nReconstruction is the other side of Deconstruction. It is about putting the subject back together again, knowing that you cannot have everything. Design is about making choices, and the three circles above symbolize your constraints. What are the three essential components of your new idea, the ones to which you will devote your time and energy? And what new value do they create together?\n04. Expression:\nExpression is giving your idea form. You build on the foundation of your new idea, and you express it as a unique prototype, a product, a strategy, a mathematical formula or a hypothesis. \nThis approach is about making design process and tools accessible, especially to nondesigners, around a project everyone shares: In life, people can solve problems with creativity and optimism. [\nDitching Gadgets May Boost Creativity\n ]\nWhich brings us back to Mars. Even if I cannot go to Mars tomorrow, I would love to work with amazingly creative scientists and engineers to bring design and science together to generate solutions for old (and new) problems. I really want to learn how to think more like a scientist. That would be the best of STEAM: I bring the \"A\" of Arts and Design, and you bring STEM, and together we do our best left- and right-brain thinking. That would be a dream come true, a life well-designed — perhaps on Mars?\nFollow all of the Expert Voices issues and debates — and become part of the discussion — on \nFacebook\n, \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "SAN FRANCISCO — The terrifying magnitude-7.8 Gorkha earthquake that rattled Nepal in April is nothing compared to the temblors scientists predict could happen in the future.\nThe shaking observed was \"unusually gentle\" given the magnitude of the earthquake, leading to far fewer landslides and glacial lake overflows than could have been seen, researchers said here today (Dec. 16) at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.\n\"The situation could have been far, far worse,\" said Jeffrey Kargel, who was a co-author on one of two related papers published today in the journal Science and presented at the meeting. He and other scientists aren't sure exactly why the quake didn't wreak more havoc, but another temblor, even of similar magnitude, to hit the area may not be so forgiving, the researchers said.\nAnd the next one may shake the earth even more: In the same rough region, there were at least three, bigger earthquakes during the medieval period whose impacts dwarfed those of the Gorkha temblor and are still altering the landscape today, according to the other study in Science. [\nSee Photos of How the Nepal Earthquake Shifted Earth\n]\nAnd past seismological assessments suggest the fault that ruptured still has energy equaling about 33 to 50 feet (10 to 15 meters) of motion that must be released, which could lead \nto even bigger earthquakes\n. The April 25 earthquake caused the fault at the boundary of the Indian and Asian plates to shift about 10 feet (3 m), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nSurprisingly gentle\nThe April 25 Gorkha earthquake uplifted low-lying regions nearby and caused the highest reaches of the Himalayas, such as \nMount Everest, to shrink\n.\nAll told, the temblor triggered a total of 4,312 landslides. One of the most catastrophic of those leveled a village in the Langtang Valley, killing about 350 people.\nDuring that landslide, huge chunks of snow and ice sitting on the steep hillsides above the valley ripped off, free-falling for about 1,640 feet (500 m) before obliterating the town of Langtang below.\n\"The energy involved was roughly half that of \nthe Hiroshima nuclear explosion\n, or more,\" Kargel said in a news briefing.\nThe air blast alone blew away large swaths of the village, including sturdy stone hotels, he said. In an area of hillsides stretching about a 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) around the landslide, the air blast snapped trees like matchsticks.\nAnd yet, it could have been much, much worse. That landslide was actually a relatively small one compared with those seen in other catastrophic earthquakes. While most of the \nlandslides\n originated at the ridge tops, some also arose in the low-lying sediments in flat valley bottoms, which is unusual (most originate on steep slopes), and some were triggered in the weeks after the earthquake, said Dan Shugar, a geohazard researcher at the University of Washington Tacoma, who is an author on the first Science paper.\nGlacial lakes held strong as well. Despite many filled-to-the-brim, precariously perched glacial lakes that seemed poised to inundate nearby villages with the slightest jolt, most did not overtop their basins, the researchers said.\nIt's not clear why the quake didn't cause more damage, but it could be that it shook unusually strong rocks in the region, or that its location somehow mitigated the damage, the researchers speculated.\nHistoric tribulations\nThe rocks in the region revealed that in the medieval period, multiple massive quakes reshaped the landscape in much more dramatic ways. [\nThe 10 Biggest Earthquakes in History\n]\nFor instance, Nepal's second biggest city, Pokhara, was built on the debris from landslides after three large quakes shook the central Himalayas between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1344. Most of the landslide rubble Pokhara was built on came from Annapurna Massif, about 9,800 feet (3,000 m) above the city, said Oliver Korup, a geohazard researcher at the University of Potsdam in Germany, who was an author on the second Science paper.\nIn addition, much of this \nmassive landslide\n rock didn't come from the nearby mountains but instead traveled from as far as 38 miles (60 km) away — likely the result of flooded lakes that carried huge amounts of rock with the deluge, Korup said.\n\"The material has really buried many of these river valleys beneath tens of meters of sediments,\" Korup said.\nFor instance, the rock fill lying below Pokhara would be enough to cover downtown San Francisco in 164 feet (50 m) of sediment, he added.\nThough scientists are still piecing together the confusing story told in rocks and faults in the region, the historic earthquakes were about a magnitude 8.0 or greater. By contrast, the Gorkha earthquake was a \"mere\" magnitude 7.8, while \nthe largest of the aftershocks was a magnitude 7.3\n.\nFollow Tia Ghose on \nTwitter\nand \nGoogle+\n. Follow Live Science \n@livescience\n, \nFacebook\n & \nGoogle+\n.

Staff workers at Cairo's Egyptian Museum mistakenly reattached it with epoxy glue, leaving scratch marks on the famous artifact after they used a spatula to wipe off the excess glue, \nLive Science reported in January\n.\nBut now, after a nine-week restoration, the mask has returned to public display at the museum, Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty said at a news conference yesterday (Dec. 17) at the museum. [\nIn Photos: The Life and Death of King Tut\n]\nThe restoration revealed newfound secrets about the mask, Eldamaty said. Researchers noticed a gold tube inside the royal beard, an intriguing structure that ancient Egyptians likely used to attach the beard to the rest of the mask, he said.\nWhat's more, ancient Egyptians also used beeswax to fasten the beard to the mask, a technique replicated by the researchers during the restoration, Eldamaty \nsaid in a statement on Facebook\n.\nKing Tut\n, who ruled Egypt from 1332 B.C. to 1323 B.C., has fascinated the public since British archaeologists Howard Carter and George Herbert discovered the boy king's \nnearly intact tomb\n in 1922. However, the beard on the funerary mask — a symbol that kings used to identify themselves to Osiris, the god of the underworld — was detached at the time it was found inside the tomb, \naccording to National Geographic\n.\n\"The 2014 damage was exaggerated, since the beard was previously detached as the examination showed,\" said Friederike Fless, the president of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, one of the German and Egyptian bodies that cooperated in the restoration process, according to National Geographic.\nThe beard remained detached until 1946, when it was reconnected using a soft solder, National Geographic reported.\nThe researchers began the new restoration in October 2015, starting with a 3D scan to document the mask. Then, over a four-week period, they heated the \nmetal mask\n and carefully removed the epoxy glue with wooden tools, National Geographic said.\nNow that the mask is back on display, the scientists are preparing a scientific study that describes the entire restoration process, Eldamaty said in the statement.\nFollow Laura Geggel on Twitter \n@LauraGeggel\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "Last week marked the start of the National Audubon Society's 116th annual Christmas Bird Count, which means it's the perfect time to unleash your inner birder and take a gander at migratory bird species as they fly south for the winter.\nEvery winter, citizen scientists \nparticipate in bird-counting events\n across North America, from mid-December until early January, to collect data on bird migrations for the National Audubon Society. This year, there will be bird counts in countries all over the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and several others listed on \nAudubon's website\n. \nThe Christmas Bird Count is the longest-running wildlife census in the United States. Data from the counts give scientists insight into birds' migratory movements that researchers would never otherwise have, such as how bird ranges have been shifting over time. [\nQuest for Survival: Incredible Animal Migrations\n]\nDatabases created from the Christmas Bird Counts have contributed to several hundred research papers over the years. \"[In] the late '70s to the early '80s, researchers began to embrace citizen science data sets,\" said Geoff LeBaron, director of the Christmas Bird Count for the National Audubon Society. In particular, the project allows scientists to \nfollow interesting migration trends\n and range shifts for hundreds of different bird species in North America, LeBaron told Live Science.\nHow the bird counts work\nEach count encompasses a circular area that is 15 miles (24 kilometers) in diameter, which has been the standard since the mid-19th century, LeBaron said.  \nThere are also two ways to participate in the bird counts: as a field observer, someone who actually walks around and counts birds; or as a feeder watcher, someone who makes observations about the different bird species visiting their home bird feeder, LeBaron told Live Science. Both types of volunteers offer valuable but different data for scientists to use.\nOnce one count is completed, the collected data are compiled and sent to the National Audubon Society so that scientists there can compare those numbers to other counts coming in from other regions of North America.\n\"There are some species of birds that could be seen on most Christmas Counts in North America,\" LeBaron said. Birds such as the American robin, starling, pigeon and black-capped chickadee are all likely to be seen, he said.\nLeBaron also mentioned that birders are more likely to see Eastern bird species farther west than they are to see Western birds farther east because Eastern birds are migrating down from Canada while Western birds are heading down toward Mexico and Central America. However, there are some differences during El Niño years. For example, LeBaron speculated that \nrecent sightings of a painted bunting\n in Brooklyn, New York, are likely due to weather anomalies from the current El Niño. (Usually, this bird lives in the southeastern U.S. and flies to Mexico for the winter, according to the \nCornell Lab of Ornithology\n.)\nWhooooo goes there?\nWhat about \nsnowy owls\n? Sightings of these majestic creatures have been highlights of past Christmas Bird Counts, and while it's possible that some people may spot them this year, there is no guarantee, LeBaron said.\n\"The snowy owl is an irruptive species,\" he said. This means that while the owls may not be consistently present in a particular area, there are seasons when there are huge spikes in snowy-owl sightings, including in places as far south as Bermuda. (In 2014, 22 snowy-owl sightings were reported in New York City alone.)\nScientists with \nProject SNOWstorm\n, which began with the \nhistoric owl irruption of 2013-2014\n, started to piece together some of the behaviors that might explain these seemingly random sightings. The scientists used backpacks equipped with GPS trackers to follow snowy-owl migration patterns, and their research suggested that snowy owls may be following the movements of lemmings, their main source of food.\nSnowy owls have been seen in parts of Canada already, LeBaron said, but it's not clear whether this year's counts will feature as many sightings of the owls as there were in 2013 and 2014.\nBut regardless of whether you want to catch a glimpse of a rare bird or just go outside and enjoy an outdoor winter activity, something that's great about the Christmas Bird Count is that anyone can participate. \"You don't need to be an experienced birder,\" LeBaron said. \"Some of the most important data [come from] looking for the birds that are supposed to be there [not rare bird sightings].\"\nFollow Elizabeth Newbern \n@liznewbern\n.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "Wearing video cameras, the world's smallest penguins have revealed their hunting secrets: The little blue-hued birds swim together to stalk groups of prey, but when it comes to catching and killing their meals, it's every penguin for itself.\nThe aptly named little penguin (Eudyptula minor) is the smallest living species of penguin, growing to an average of 13 inches (33 centimeters) high and 17 inches (43 cm) long.\nPrevious research suggested that \nlittle penguins\n spent ample amounts of time swimming together when hunting food. Researchers wanted to learn more about why these birds formed groups when foraging, such as whether doing so gives them a better chance at capturing anchovies, krill, jellyfish and other prey. [\nSee Photos of All 18 Penguin Species\n]\nThe scientists equipped 21 little penguins from two breeding colonies in southeastern Australia with cameras, GPS trackers, and depth and time recorders. The video cameras faced forward to give a penguin's-eye view.\n\"By putting video cameras on little penguins, this has been the first time we have been able to get a glimpse, literally, into their behavior and how they interact with other penguins at sea,\" said study lead author Grace Sutton, an ecologist at Deakin University in Burwood, Australia.\nThe researchers attached the devices to the backs of the penguins with special waterproof tape that does not destroy the plumage of the birds when the tape is removed. Altogether, these devices weighed about 1.25 ounces (35.4 grams), less than 3 percent of the average weight of the birds; they were removed after each bird made a foraging trip.\n\"The penguins I work on are the smallest of all the penguin species, but they make up for it with how feisty, wriggly and aggressive they are,\" Sutton told Live Science. \"It constantly amazes me how strong they are.\"\nDuring the breeding season, the penguins leave their nests at sunrise and return after dusk to feed their chicks. The scientists found that little penguins were more likely to swim together when hunting groups of prey than when encountering solitary prey.\nSurprisingly, \"the penguins had no more chance of capturing a meal when they were in groups than when alone,\" Sutton said. The birds may swim together, but they apparently do not work together after they encounter prey.\nThe researchers did find that little penguins were more likely to encounter schooling prey than solitary prey when the birds foraged in groups. This suggested that the penguins \"hunt in groups in order to find prey and avoid predation by safety in numbers,\" Sutton said. \"But, once they find prey, it is every penguin for themselves.\"\nThe scientists detailed their findings online Dec. 16 in the journal \nPLOS ONE\n.\nFollow Charles Q.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "Washington Governor Jay Inslee has ordered corrections officials to halt some prison releases after announcing today around 3,200 prisoners were released early due to a programming error, according to a \nreport from NBC affiliate King-5 News\n. The error dates back to 2002, when the Washington Supreme Court ordered the Department of Corrections (DOC) to apply \"good time\" credit, such as participation in rehabilitation programs, earned in county prisons to state sentences. For more than a decade, the DOC's system has been over-crediting some inmates and releasing them before their sentences were up.\n\"That this problem was allowed to continue for 13 years is deeply disappointing to me, totally unacceptable and, frankly, maddening,\" Inslee said today at a press conference. The problem was first discovered in 2012, but a fix was reportedly delayed numerous times, leading the state's new chief information officer to alert DOC officials to the severity of the problem. The state puts the median amount of time a prisoner was released early at 49 days.\nA software patch is scheduled to go out on January 7th\nAs for the previously incarcerated prisoners, authorities will force them to return to prison to finish their sentence or complete it through a work release program. The state plans on working with local law enforcement to determine who will be brought back, and King-5 News reports five inmates have already been returned to prison. A software patch is scheduled to go out on January 7th. Meanwhile, Inslee says the state has hired two retired federal prosecutors to discover out how the problem persisted for so long.\nMore from theverge.com:\nSpaceX successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket after launching it to space\n \nMoto 360 Sport review\n \nCards Against Humanity buys Picasso, threatens to chop it to bits and give it away\n \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens — The Verge's deep-dive roundtable discussion\n \nThe best thing about the SpaceX rocket landing was the human reaction\n \nThese headphones were designed by audiophiles, and they're glorious\n \nThe Verge 2015 Holiday Gift Guide\n \nThe 10 best video games of 2015\n \nThe Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino at his most sophisticated and sloppy\n \nA complete guide to the new Star Wars canon before The Force Awakens\n \nMicrosoft Lumia 950 XL review\n \nThe physics of Star Wars' Starkiller Base: could that really happen?\n", "link": "http://news.yahoo.com/thousands-prisoners-washington-got-early-220142017.html?.b=tech%2F%3F.b%3Dindex%252f&.cf3=&.cf4=10&.cf5=The+Verge&.cf6=%2Ftech%2F", "comments": [], "title": "Thousands of prisoners in Washington got out early because of a software glitch"}

It takes on edibles ranging from grapes to popcorn to a doughnut covered in icing and sprinkles.\nThere's a high entertainment factor to watching a drone go all \"\nChopped\n\" on a variety of comestibles.

The camera can shoot at 1,500 frames per second, making for a super-smooth slo-mo experience.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "Starting Wednesday at 8AM, Lyft will become the first ride-sharing company approved to pick up and drop off passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, Mayor Eric Garcetti \nannounced today\n. The ride-sharing company with the pink mustache beat its much bigger rival, Uber, to the airport, which handled around 70 million passengers in 2014 and is the world's fifth busiest.\n\"Tomorrow, we will have ‘Lyft-off' at LAX, giving our passengers what they have been asking for, another safe and convenient way to get to and from the airport,\" Garcetti said in a statement. He noted that LAX's terminals were undergoing a makeover, which includes a rail link, but in the meantime \"passengers deserve access to all available options to ensure they have an excellent experience.\"\n\"Tomorrow, we will have ‘Lyft-off' at LAX... \"\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved the license agreement earlier this year, paving the way for transportation network company pick-ups at LAX, as long as they pay the airport $4 per trip. Garcetti's office said that ride-sharing companies that complete the application can being servicing LAX, but a spokesperson for Uber would not say what the status of its application. In the meantime, Lyft is offering $5 to all customers both to and from the airport until New Year's Day.\nThis isn't the first time Lyft has beaten Uber to a fare-rich airport. In October, the company announced it had become the \nfirst ride-sharing company to strike a deal with Las Vegas's McCarran International Airport\n. Uber won approval there weeks later.\nAirports, in general, have proven to be inhospitable places to companies like Uber and Lyft, with their myriad of regulations and special interests. Regular taxi owners have also lobbied to prevent startups from encroaching on their turf. Forty-nine of the 100 busiest airports in the US prohibit private ride-sharing, according to a \nsurvey by Blacklane\n, a Berlin-based limo service.\nMore from theverge.com:\nSpaceX successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket after launching it to space\n \nMoto 360 Sport review\n \nCards Against Humanity buys Picasso, threatens to chop it to bits and give it away\n \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens — The Verge's deep-dive roundtable discussion\n \nThe best thing about the SpaceX rocket landing was the human reaction\n \nThese headphones were designed by audiophiles, and they're glorious\n \nThe Verge 2015 Holiday Gift Guide\n \nThe 10 best video games of 2015\n \nThe Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino at his most sophisticated and sloppy\n \nA complete guide to the new Star Wars canon before The Force Awakens\n \nMicrosoft Lumia 950 XL review\n \nThe physics of Star Wars' Starkiller Base: could that really happen?\n", "link": "http://news.yahoo.com/lyft-beats-uber-become-first-233730094.html?.b=tech%2F%3F.b%3Dindex%252f&.cf3=&.cf4=5&.cf5=The+Verge&.cf6=%2Ftech%2F", "comments": [], "title": "Lyft beats Uber to become first ride-hailing app allowed at LAX"}
{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "This article, \nStar Wars urns store your ashes in a Death Star or Vader helmet\n, originally appeared on \nCNET.com\n.\nWhen it's time to cross into the dark side of this life, this vessel could be the final resting place for your ashes.\nUrns For Ashes\nYou can do a lot of unusual things with your body after you die, including \nhaving your ashes turned into a diamond\n or \na coral reef\n. But for the true Star Wars fan, there's one ultimate option -- a \nDarth Vader or Death Star urn made by Urns for Ashes\n, a UK-based company that creates a range of containers to house the ashes of the departed.\nWhile you might expect Star Wars-themed urns to be a gag to capitalize on \nthe release of \"The Force Awakens,\"\n they've actually become hot sellers for the company. In fact, Darren Williams told CNET's Crave blog that they have quickly become one of his best-selling products, with inquiries seeing a 300 percent increase since Star Wars fever hit consumers as the new film approached.\nWhen the urns went up on his site at the beginning of last month, he was getting about 400 inquiries per week, he said. Then around the November 11 -- probably because interest in the new film was beginning to snowball -- those requests skyrocketed to more than 1,300 per week.\nThe attention his company got from the Star Wars urns has led to some other unusual requests, Williams said.\n\"It's led to some crazy inquiries too,\" he said. \"People want superhero urns, landmark urns (like football stadium urns), really specific car urns and a lady this week actually asked if I could create a life-size replica of her dog that passed away.\"\nRelated stories \nStar Wars condoms keep your saber covered\n \nMy inner 10-year-old and I review 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'\n \nCrazy things to do with your body after you die (pictures)\nSuch requests are quite acceptable to Williams, who says the Star Wars urn, or any other custom urn, is made through 3D printing, so a large degree of customization is possible. That includes an inscription on the base. I was thinking this Yoda quote from \"Revenge of the Sith\" might be perfect:\n\"Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.\"\nAlthough the Vader and Death Star urns are temporarily out of stock, Williams says his manufacturer is currently racing to create more and they'll soon be back on his virtual shelves. Both urns cost £150 (about $223, AU$310) and shipping is available worldwide for an extra fee.\nBring Star Wars home, room by room (pictures)\nYou might not live on Tatooine or drive a landspeeder to work, but that doesn't mean you can't make your house feel more at home in the Star Wars universe. Begin in the bedroom, where nothing will get you in the mood faster than this \nsplashy lightsaber lamp\n on the nightstand. In the mood to see the upcoming film \"\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens\n,\" of course.\nThis BB-8 life-size plush from \nThinkGeek\n is a little less tacky (but no less fun) than the lightsaber lamp. Put one on each nightstand in your guest room and your visitors will have no doubt where your passions lie.\nR2-D2 was certainly a helpful little droid. Now you too can call him into service in your bathroom, where he'll sit silently on the countertop guarding your toothbrush from rogue Stormtroopers.\nThis toothbrush holder\n is made from resin for easy cleanup and also has a light-up feature that can guide you to better dental health even if your bathroom is overcome by the dark side.\nDarth Vader certainly wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, and now he can help you get yours clean thanks to \nthis liquid-soap pump\n. It measures about 6.75 inches by 5 inches by 4.75 inches (17 centimeters by 13 centimeters by 12 centimeters) and is made from resin, so it won't shatter if he surprises you in the middle of the night and you knock him to the floor. We're not so sure Vader would appreciate being made into a soap dispenser, but that's what happens to bad guys, right?\nWhile you might not be such a Star Wars fan that you'd adorn your toilet bowl with \nsarlacc-pit decals\n, you can still bring a touch of the Force into your bathroom -- forceful water pressure, at least. All you need to do is swap out your showerhead for \none of these Star Wars-themed versions\n and you'll be able to get clean with Darth Vader or R2-D2 looking on.\nOn second thought...\nIf your guests are true geeks, they'll know \nthese hand towels from ThinkGeek\n are a nod to that scene in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" when Princess Leia professes her love to Han Solo just before he's frozen in carbonite. \"I love you,\" she says. His mock-cocky response: \"I know.\"\nThe towels are imprinted with a band of Rebel Alliance insignias on the back.\nIf your kids have bad dreams, \nthis decal of a lightsaber-wielding Yoda\n above their beds should go a long way toward scaring the nightmares off. The decal is made from vinyl and backed by a repositionable adhesive that helps make putting it up a little easier. Plus, when your kid goes off to college, you can move it into your own room.\nThe decal comes in four sizes ranging from 8x13 inches (about 20x33 centimeters) to 22x36 inches (about 56x91 centimeters).\nYour kids might just look forward to going to sleep if their bed is covered in these \nStar Wars throw pillows\n from Pottery Barn. There are four different pillows available: the droid BB-8 and bad guy Kylo Ren from the upcoming \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" film; a Stormtrooper; and an R2-D2 version shaped like the diminutive droid himself. The pillows are made from cotton, and the raised stitching helps the characters really come alive.\nBonus: When the kids outgrow the pillows, the cases are reversible to solid colors. But really, why would you do that when you can just move them to your sofa as is and let your fan flag fly?\nThere are so many Star Wars kitchen gadgets out there you'd think all anyone did a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away was fry up eggs and make peanut butter and Jedi -- I mean jelly -- sandwiches.\nBut our top pick for the must-have Star Wars kitchen appliance is \nthis Darth Vader toaster\n. Not only does it look like the Dark Lord, it also imprints each piece of toast with his likeness on one side and the Star Wars logo on the other. If that doesn't help you wake up in the morning, we're not sure what will.\nWhile the Death Star was built to destroy planets, you'll be able to destroy morning hunger by churning out 7-inch (8-centimeter) waffles that look just like the moon-size battle station with this \nnifty gadget from ThinkGeek\n.\nAs CNET's \nAmanda Kooser\n says in her write-up of the gadget: \"The Death Star's design makes for an ideal set of indentations to capture invading maple syrup and provide containment for fresh berries and whipped cream.\"\nOnce your Darth toast and Death Star waffles are made, you have to eat them with something, right? No ordinary cutlery could possible stand up to the awesomeness on your plate, so you want to consider \nthese utensils modeled after Darth Vader's lightsaber\n.\nThe fork, knife and spoon set is made from stainless steel and plastic, and measures approximately 194-215 millimeters (7.5 to 8.5 inches) by 16.5 millimeters (a little over half an inch). Not only is the cutlery a great way to dine on the dark side, but it's probably a perfect way to get fussy little ones to finish their peas. After all, Sith Lords don't whine.\nIn the Star Wars universe, droids were handy for lots of things, including projecting secret messages, co-piloting X-wing fighters and generally running interference with the bad guys. In your home, they might not be able to help out quite as much, but they can add some pizzaz to snacks. Just put your cheese and crackers on \nthis BB-8 platter\n to enlist the rolling droid's help, and not only will your snacks look better, but you'll have a conversation starter.\nIf BB-8 doesn't appeal, ThinkGeek -- maker of the platter -- also has a Millennium Falcon version that enlists Han Solo's spacecraft in what is likely the least dangerous mission of its career. Unless, of course, you just don't have a knack with snacks, in which case the ship will come to your rescue by deflecting negative comments.\nWhen you're part of the Rebel Alliance, you need to cut loose from time to time -- perhaps with a little liquid refreshment?\nWhen you're done sipping your merlot or your \nCorellian whiskey\n, stop the bottle back up with this nifty R2-D2 bottle topper. Because this droid has a certain aversion to liquids, your hooch will be safe under his watchful eye circuitry.\nNo doubt you'll want to have a romantic night in front of the TV binge-watching all of the Star Wars episodes before the premiere of \"The Force Awakens\" in December.\nNothing says romance to two lovers of blasters, battles and Boba Fett than these candleholders made in the shape of Darth Vader's lightsaber handle. Each holder is made from solid metal, and the set of two also comes with three red (of course) dripless candles.\nFor some extra excitement, buy yourself a blue candle and put it in one of the holders while a red one burns in the other. If blue (the color of Luke and Obi-Wan's saber) burns out first, the dark side wins.\nSo you've lit your lightsaber candles and you're about to press play and unleash John Willams' epic Star Wars score. Is something missing? Of course! This plush \nChewbacca-skin rug\n.\nAvailable in two sizes -- 6x3 inches (about 1.8 meters by 1 meter) or 8x4 inches (about 2.4 meters by 1.2 meters) -- this rug is not only comfortable underfoot, it's also something of an insider's joke, hearkening back to the time in \"A New Hope\" when Princess Leia calls Chewbacca a \"walking carpet.\" It's also the perfect surface to sit upon while enjoying \na game of holochess\n.\nThe black and white bandolier stretching across the middle of the rug really sets the rug apart and lets you know the design was inspired by the No. 1 Wookiee in the galaxy. But don't worry. The makers of this piece of kitsch promise that \"no Wookiees were harmed in the making of these rugs.\"\nIf you're lucky enough to have a media room in your house, \nthis collection of four Star Wars works of art\n might be the perfect bit of wall candy to hang there. Featuring Darth Vader, Yoda, Chewbacca and\nC3PO and R2-D2 (the latter two together), all dressed in formal wear, the images are printed onto vintage dictionary pages that are at least 80 years old. That means no two are ever the same -- kind of like the experience of watching the original \"Star Wars\" movie again and again.\nWhile you might want to watch nothing but \"A New Hope\" in your media room, the rest of the family might not share your passion. So this \nrepositionable vinyl decal\n from Etsy user Citystic might be the next best thing. The wall ornamentation recalls the opening scene of the very first \"Star Wars\" movie every time you look at it -- no remote control required.\nNeed a little motivation to keep you getting your work done? How about \nthis light that makes it look like Darth Vader just burst through your wall\n and is looking over your shoulder? If a Sith Lord doesn't get you working away, we're not sure what will.\nOf course, if you respond better to a kinder approach, 3D Lights, the creator of the Vader model, also makes a \nYoda version\n. \"Finish your work you will.\"\nThe kits come with a decal that makes the wall look like it's been shattered an outline lets you perfectly position the battery-operated light itself.\nThis Star Wars clock\n will help you keep time in true fan style.\nMade by Etsy seller YougNeek (pronounced \"unique\"), the clock features 12 different battleships and other craft from Star Wars affixed around the outer edge where the numbers would normally be. The seller indicates that the exact ships might vary on a clock-by-clock basis, but if you want a specific ship included, the request can usually be accommodated. The clock measures about 12 inches (30 centimeters) in diameter and runs on a single AA battery -- not \nhypermatter\n as you may have thought.\nSure there are desktop speakers out there that mightl sound better than \nthis one\n, but you'd be hard-pressed to find another that looks as cool as this one shaped like a Stormtrooper's helmet.\nThe speaker is Bluetooth-compatible so it can play more than just the Imperial March and measures 4.13 inches by 4.66 inches by 5 inches (10.5 centimeters by 11.8 centimeters by 12.7 centimeters). Not the biggest blaster in the galaxy, but it should get the job done if it's sitting near you on your desk.\nSimple yet oh-so clever, \nthese switch-plate decals\n bring the epic contest inherent in the Force to any room. Tired of wallowing in the dark side? Then just flip the switch up and you're back on the light side.\nThe decal is available for both single-switch and dual-switch configurations. Unlike the wall decal we mentioned before, though, these decals are not repositionable, so make sure you're in a Jedi state of mind to act calmly, swiftly and accurately before applying them.\nThere's no reason to exclude the outside of your home when you're getting into Star Wars mode. \nThis fallen AT-AT (all terrain armored transport) lawn ornament\n tells the whole neighborhood you're a member of the Rebel Alliance and you have no problem displaying the downed machinery of your sworn enemy on your front lawn.\nAs you might imagine, even its fallen state, the AT-AT is pretty tough. It's made from resin that can withstand sun, rain and snow. The doodad measures approximately 15 inches by 6.4 inches by 7.5 inches (about 38 by 16 by 19 centimeters).\n", "link": "http://news.yahoo.com/star-wars-urns-store-ashes-225351263.html?.b=tech%2F%3F.b%3Dindex%252f&.cf3=&.cf4=7&.cf5=CNET&.cf6=%2Ftech%2F", "comments": [], "title": "Star Wars urns store your ashes in a Death Star or Vader helmet"}

Abrams-directed movie.\n\"The new director's set-up fails most spectacularly in its representation of evil, meaning the negative characters,\" the paper mused, \naccording to a LA Times translation\n. \"Darth Vader and, above all, the Emperor Palpatine were two of the most efficient villains in that genre of American cinema.\"\nI'm not entirely convinced that the greatest characteristic of a villain is to be efficient. I rather imagined true villainy should scare the trousers off of people.\nStill, the paper wasn't impressed with Adam Driver, who plays villan Kylo Ren in the movie. \"The counterpart of Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, wears a mask merely to emulate his predecessor.\"\nIt pours even greater scorn on the new uber-bad wolf. \"The character who needs to substitute the emperor Palpatine as the incarnation of supreme evil represents the most serious defect of the film,\" the paper said. \"Without revealing anything about the character, all we will say is that it is the clumsiest and tackiest result you can obtain from computer graphics.\"\nThis is not a sentence I will likely write very often in my life: The Vatican is right.\nWhen Kylo takes off his mask to reveal the slightly twisted boy who cavorts with Lena Dunham in HBO series \"Girls,\" he looks like a teen who's borrowed dad's car without telling him.\nMore Technically Incorrect \n'SNL' skewers hoverboards\n \nChurch fights the Dark Side, holds special Star Wars service\n \nHow Apple is getting aggressive toward customers\nYou might tell me that this is the point of the character. I might tell you that what follows makes his character even more drip-dried.\nAs for Snoke, the new alleged supervillain is about as frightening as the balloons that waft down Manhattan on Thanksgiving Day.\nIt might be that in subsequent episodes of this modern day Epistle to the Nerds, these villains will become darker and more intimidating.\nThe Vatican likely hopes so. Pope Francis has been very keen since his ascension to underline the existence of an entity he\n has variously described\n as \"Satan,\" \"the Accuser,\" \"the Evil One,\" \"the Father of Lies,\" \"the Ancient Serpent,\" \"the Tempter,\" \"the Seducer\" and \"the Great Dragon.\"\nCurrently, though, many might fear our serpent-like politicians more than these \"Star Wars\" satans.

{"source": "crawler_yahoo", "article": "YouTube isn't happy with \nT-Mobile's new Binge On program\n. The program, which launched last month, prevents T-Mobile subscribers from streaming HD video and in exchange allows them to stream video from Netflix, HBO Go, and a number of other services without having it count toward their data cap. Notably, YouTube is not part of that program. But its video is being downgraded to around 480p quality anyway, and it would prefer that not be the case. In a statement provided \nto The Wall Street Journal\n, YouTube says, \"Reducing data charges can be good for users, but it doesn’t justify throttling all video services, especially without explicit user consent.\"\nBinge On is automatically enabled for T-Mobile customers\nThere are two issues with Binge On that YouTube calls out in its brief statement. First, Binge On reduces the quality of all streaming video, regardless of whether it's coming from a video service that's a partner or not. That means that YouTube's streaming quality is hurt by Binge On, but T-Mobile customers get no benefit in exchange — it still counts toward their data cap (albeit, they use less data than they would have when streaming HD). YouTube also calls out T-Mobile for not requiring its subscribers to explicitely enable this new feature. Instead, Binge On was automatically activated for all existing T-Mobile subscribers on its standard plan, so long as they're paying for at least 3GB of data each month. Binge On can be turned off at any time, but T-Mobile customers need to know about it to turn it off, and many likely aren't aware that it exists.\nYouTube's criticism comes right as the Federal Communications Commissions is \nbeginning to look into T-Mobile's practice\n of allowing select services to be used data-free, as well as similar practices from other companies. The commission last week sent a letter to T-Mobile asking for further information on both its Binge On program and its data-free music streaming program, Music Freedom. The FCC's new net neutrality rules forbid traffic throttling and prioritization, but the commission has avoided questions as to whether programs like Binge On break those rules or appropriately skirt around them. With this inquiry, we could be starting down a path that'll eventually get us a clear answer.\nT-Mobile did not provide the Journal with a response to YouTube's criticism, instead providing a stock promotional line about how customers can disable Binge On if they want to. In response to an email from The Verge, T-Mobile pointed to \na tweet\n from its CEO reiterating those remarks.\nAccording to the Journal, YouTube isn't included in the Binge On program because T-Mobile is unable to consistently identify YouTube's traffic. T-Mobile says it's had discussions with YouTube about inclusion, but more technical work would be needed. YouTube did not respond to a request for further comment.\nFor now, it sounds like YouTube doesn't want to be a part of Binge On anyway. While Binge On might allow for more streaming, hurting video quality might hurt overall usage of YouTube, too. If YouTube wants its videos to stream at top quality for everyone, it'll need to get T-Mobile to stop downgrading nearly every video that passes through its subscribers' phones.\nMore from theverge.com:\nSpaceX successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket after launching it to space\n \nMoto 360 Sport review\n \nCards Against Humanity buys Picasso, threatens to chop it to bits and give it away\n \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens — The Verge's deep-dive roundtable discussion\n \nThe best thing about the SpaceX rocket landing was the human reaction\n \nThese headphones were designed by audiophiles, and they're glorious\n \nThe Verge 2015 Holiday Gift Guide\n \nThe 10 best video games of 2015\n \nThe Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino at his most sophisticated and sloppy\n \nA complete guide to the new Star Wars canon before The Force Awakens\n \nMicrosoft Lumia 950 XL review\n \nThe physics of Star Wars' Starkiller Base: could that really happen?\n", "link": "http://news.yahoo.com/youtube-doesnt-t-mobiles-low-001443075.html?.b=tech%2F%3F.b%3Dindex%252f&.cf3=&.cf4=3&.cf5=The+Verge&.cf6=%2Ftech%2F", "comments": [], "title": "YouTube doesn't like T-Mobile's low-quality video scheme"}
