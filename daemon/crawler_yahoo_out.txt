This turns out to be quite an effective method for distributing pollen, the researchers found. \nAs the bee's common name suggests, its abdomen is banded by metallic blue stripes, strikingly different from the yellow and black stripes usually found on honeybees. Native to Australia, blue-banded bees are solitary, with females building individual burrows in soil or clay. [\nVideo: Headbanging Bee Puts Metal Heads to Shame\n]\nGetting a buzz\nBlue-banded bees, like many other bee species, are known as \"buzz-pollinators.\" To pollinate a flower, these bees were thought to use their mandibles to grasp the part of the stamen that contains the pollen, and shake the pollen loose by vibrating their flight muscles. This type of pollination is necessary for plants that hold their pollen in a capsule, such as \ntomato plants\n.\nThe researchers combined several techniques, including audio recordings and high-speed video, to compare the native blue-banded bees' tomato-pollinating prowess with another species commonly used in Australia for pollinating tomato plants, the North American \nbumblebee\n (Bombus impatiens).\nWhen the scientists listened to audio recordings of the bees, they found that A. murrayensis buzzed at higher frequencies than the bumblebees. They also noticed that the blue-banded bee spent less time at every flower than the bumblebee, and typically visited each flower only once.\nHeadbangers' ball\nBut the most telling difference was revealed on video: nine clips of pollinating bees recorded at 2,000 frames per second. Instead of clutching the flower's stamen and shaking it to release the \npollen\n, A. murrayensis was doing something completely unique. The bee would rapidly \"bang\" its head against the pollen cone at a very high rate of speed, calculated by the scientists to be 350 times per second. \nThe scientists were \"absolutely surprised,\" study co-author Sridhar Ravi, a research fellow at the School of Aerospace, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Engineering at RMIT University in Australia, said in a statement. None of them had ever observed this type of behavior before. \"This is something totally new,\" Ravi said.\nThere were clear benefits to this unusual approach, the researchers reported. The higher frequency of the headbanging vibration would not only work well to break up clumps of wet pollen, but could also dislodge more pollen overall, which would explain why the bees' \nflower visits\n were shorter, and why they only visited once.\nAccording to a statement by study co-author Katja Hogendoorn, a bee specialist with the School of Agriculture, Food and Wine at the University of Adelaide, previous research had already demonstrated that the blue-banded bees were effective pollinators. Now, knowing that they needed less time per flower suggests that the headbanging bees would also be very efficient pollinators, Hogendoorn said.\nThe findings were published online Dec. 1 in the journal \nArthropod-Plant Interactions\n.\nFollow Mindy Weisberger on \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n.

Researchers wanted to learn more about why these birds formed groups when foraging, such as whether doing so gives them a better chance at capturing anchovies, krill, jellyfish and other prey. [\nSee Photos of All 18 Penguin Species\n]\nThe scientists equipped 21 little penguins from two breeding colonies in southeastern Australia with cameras, GPS trackers, and depth and time recorders. The video cameras faced forward to give a penguin's-eye view.\n\"By putting video cameras on little penguins, this has been the first time we have been able to get a glimpse, literally, into their behavior and how they interact with other penguins at sea,\" said study lead author Grace Sutton, an ecologist at Deakin University in Burwood, Australia.\nThe researchers attached the devices to the backs of the penguins with special waterproof tape that does not destroy the plumage of the birds when the tape is removed. Altogether, these devices weighed about 1.25 ounces (35.4 grams), less than 3 percent of the average weight of the birds; they were removed after each bird made a foraging trip.\n\"The penguins I work on are the smallest of all the penguin species, but they make up for it with how feisty, wriggly and aggressive they are,\" Sutton told Live Science. \"It constantly amazes me how strong they are.\"\nDuring the breeding season, the penguins leave their nests at sunrise and return after dusk to feed their chicks. The scientists found that little penguins were more likely to swim together when hunting groups of prey than when encountering solitary prey.\nSurprisingly, \"the penguins had no more chance of capturing a meal when they were in groups than when alone,\" Sutton said. The birds may swim together, but they apparently do not work together after they encounter prey.\nThe researchers did find that little penguins were more likely to encounter schooling prey than solitary prey when the birds foraged in groups. This suggested that the penguins \"hunt in groups in order to find prey and avoid predation by safety in numbers,\" Sutton said. \"But, once they find prey, it is every penguin for themselves.\"\nThe scientists detailed their findings online Dec. 16 in the journal \nPLOS ONE\n.\nFollow Charles Q.

He and other scientists aren't sure exactly why the quake didn't wreak more havoc, but another temblor, even of similar magnitude, to hit the area may not be so forgiving, the researchers said.\nAnd the next one may shake the earth even more: In the same rough region, there were at least three, bigger earthquakes during the medieval period whose impacts dwarfed those of the Gorkha temblor and are still altering the landscape today, according to the other study in Science. [\nSee Photos of How the Nepal Earthquake Shifted Earth\n]\nAnd past seismological assessments suggest the fault that ruptured still has energy equaling about 33 to 50 feet (10 to 15 meters) of motion that must be released, which could lead \nto even bigger earthquakes\n. The April 25 earthquake caused the fault at the boundary of the Indian and Asian plates to shift about 10 feet (3 m), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nSurprisingly gentle\nThe April 25 Gorkha earthquake uplifted low-lying regions nearby and caused the highest reaches of the Himalayas, such as \nMount Everest, to shrink\n.\nAll told, the temblor triggered a total of 4,312 landslides. One of the most catastrophic of those leveled a village in the Langtang Valley, killing about 350 people.\nDuring that landslide, huge chunks of snow and ice sitting on the steep hillsides above the valley ripped off, free-falling for about 1,640 feet (500 m) before obliterating the town of Langtang below.\n\"The energy involved was roughly half that of \nthe Hiroshima nuclear explosion\n, or more,\" Kargel said in a news briefing.\nThe air blast alone blew away large swaths of the village, including sturdy stone hotels, he said. In an area of hillsides stretching about a 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) around the landslide, the air blast snapped trees like matchsticks.\nAnd yet, it could have been much, much worse. That landslide was actually a relatively small one compared with those seen in other catastrophic earthquakes. While most of the \nlandslides\n originated at the ridge tops, some also arose in the low-lying sediments in flat valley bottoms, which is unusual (most originate on steep slopes), and some were triggered in the weeks after the earthquake, said Dan Shugar, a geohazard researcher at the University of Washington Tacoma, who is an author on the first Science paper.\nGlacial lakes held strong as well. Despite many filled-to-the-brim, precariously perched glacial lakes that seemed poised to inundate nearby villages with the slightest jolt, most did not overtop their basins, the researchers said.\nIt's not clear why the quake didn't cause more damage, but it could be that it shook unusually strong rocks in the region, or that its location somehow mitigated the damage, the researchers speculated.\nHistoric tribulations\nThe rocks in the region revealed that in the medieval period, multiple massive quakes reshaped the landscape in much more dramatic ways. [\nThe 10 Biggest Earthquakes in History\n]\nFor instance, Nepal's second biggest city, Pokhara, was built on the debris from landslides after three large quakes shook the central Himalayas between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1344. Most of the landslide rubble Pokhara was built on came from Annapurna Massif, about 9,800 feet (3,000 m) above the city, said Oliver Korup, a geohazard researcher at the University of Potsdam in Germany, who was an author on the second Science paper.\nIn addition, much of this \nmassive landslide\n rock didn't come from the nearby mountains but instead traveled from as far as 38 miles (60 km) away — likely the result of flooded lakes that carried huge amounts of rock with the deluge, Korup said.\n\"The material has really buried many of these river valleys beneath tens of meters of sediments,\" Korup said.\nFor instance, the rock fill lying below Pokhara would be enough to cover downtown San Francisco in 164 feet (50 m) of sediment, he added.\nThough scientists are still piecing together the confusing story told in rocks and faults in the region, the historic earthquakes were about a magnitude 8.0 or greater. By contrast, the Gorkha earthquake was a \"mere\" magnitude 7.8, while \nthe largest of the aftershocks was a magnitude 7.3\n.\nFollow Tia Ghose on \nTwitter\nand \nGoogle+\n. Follow Live Science \n@livescience\n, \nFacebook\n & \nGoogle+\n.

This year, there will be bird counts in countries all over the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and several others listed on \nAudubon's website\n. \nThe Christmas Bird Count is the longest-running wildlife census in the United States. Data from the counts give scientists insight into birds' migratory movements that researchers would never otherwise have, such as how bird ranges have been shifting over time. [\nQuest for Survival: Incredible Animal Migrations\n]\nDatabases created from the Christmas Bird Counts have contributed to several hundred research papers over the years. \"[In] the late '70s to the early '80s, researchers began to embrace citizen science data sets,\" said Geoff LeBaron, director of the Christmas Bird Count for the National Audubon Society. In particular, the project allows scientists to \nfollow interesting migration trends\n and range shifts for hundreds of different bird species in North America, LeBaron told Live Science.\nHow the bird counts work\nEach count encompasses a circular area that is 15 miles (24 kilometers) in diameter, which has been the standard since the mid-19th century, LeBaron said.  \nThere are also two ways to participate in the bird counts: as a field observer, someone who actually walks around and counts birds; or as a feeder watcher, someone who makes observations about the different bird species visiting their home bird feeder, LeBaron told Live Science. Both types of volunteers offer valuable but different data for scientists to use.\nOnce one count is completed, the collected data are compiled and sent to the National Audubon Society so that scientists there can compare those numbers to other counts coming in from other regions of North America.\n\"There are some species of birds that could be seen on most Christmas Counts in North America,\" LeBaron said. Birds such as the American robin, starling, pigeon and black-capped chickadee are all likely to be seen, he said.\nLeBaron also mentioned that birders are more likely to see Eastern bird species farther west than they are to see Western birds farther east because Eastern birds are migrating down from Canada while Western birds are heading down toward Mexico and Central America. However, there are some differences during El Niño years. For example, LeBaron speculated that \nrecent sightings of a painted bunting\n in Brooklyn, New York, are likely due to weather anomalies from the current El Niño. (Usually, this bird lives in the southeastern U.S. and flies to Mexico for the winter, according to the \nCornell Lab of Ornithology\n.)\nWhooooo goes there?\nWhat about \nsnowy owls\n? Sightings of these majestic creatures have been highlights of past Christmas Bird Counts, and while it's possible that some people may spot them this year, there is no guarantee, LeBaron said.\n\"The snowy owl is an irruptive species,\" he said. This means that while the owls may not be consistently present in a particular area, there are seasons when there are huge spikes in snowy-owl sightings, including in places as far south as Bermuda. (In 2014, 22 snowy-owl sightings were reported in New York City alone.)\nScientists with \nProject SNOWstorm\n, which began with the \nhistoric owl irruption of 2013-2014\n, started to piece together some of the behaviors that might explain these seemingly random sightings. The scientists used backpacks equipped with GPS trackers to follow snowy-owl migration patterns, and their research suggested that snowy owls may be following the movements of lemmings, their main source of food.\nSnowy owls have been seen in parts of Canada already, LeBaron said, but it's not clear whether this year's counts will feature as many sightings of the owls as there were in 2013 and 2014.\nBut regardless of whether you want to catch a glimpse of a rare bird or just go outside and enjoy an outdoor winter activity, something that's great about the Christmas Bird Count is that anyone can participate. \"You don't need to be an experienced birder,\" LeBaron said. \"Some of the most important data [come from] looking for the birds that are supposed to be there [not rare bird sightings].\"\nFollow Elizabeth Newbern \n@liznewbern\n.

Meanwhile, at some locations of the East Coast sports club chain that includes New York Sports Club, Boston Sports Club and Washington Sports Club, a class called \"Awaken Your Inner Force\" is offered. In San Diego and other California cities, a Meetup group called the Lightsaber Team gets together for \"Star Wars\"-themed exercise.\nIn the Hawaii class, the students are sweating and smiling by the end, Mylett told Live Science. It gets your heart rate up, he said.\nThe workout — which is similar to any type of martial arts training involving staffs, swords or sticks —targets the muscles in the upper body, Mylett said.\nThe toy lightsabers used in his class weigh 3 to 5 lbs. (1.4 to 2.3 kilograms), he said. \"When held at arms length for nearly an hour straight, there is definitely some burn in the arms, back and shoulders,\" he said. There are also some benefits to your core and legs from holding a \"strong, mindful stance\" for an extended period of time, he added.\nThe workouts were designed by watching fight scenes from the movies and applying those movements to sword basics and easy-to-learn \"blade on blade\" fight choreography, Mylett said. \nEach class begins by warming up the arms and wrists. Then, the students are taught some basic lightsaber movements, focusing on proper form, aim, speed and power, Mylett said. Next, the instructors teach the choreography of the workout using a number system so students can remember the moves before partnering up to practice, he said.\nEach class ends with a short \nmeditation\n on the Force.\nMylett has his \"padawans,\" or Jedi trainees, start out using a 36-inch lightsaber blade and a two-handed grip. \"This is to emphasize safety and control — two hands can more easily stop a blade,\" he said.\nThe two-handed beginner technique is called \"Shii Cho\" and is \"perfect for padawans\" and \"taking out a battalion of \nbattle droids\n,\" Mylett said.\nMore advanced Jedi fighters then learn the Makashi style, which uses lighter-weight lightsabers that allow for one-handed attacks, he said. This form is \"perfect for battling a Sith Lord one on one,\" Mylett said.\nAnd for the Jedi master, there's the Soresu style, a more defensive form with \"lots of flair,\" in which Jedi create arcs to defend the body, he said. \"Perfect for deflecting blaster fire,\" he said.\nFor those interested in sparring at home, a 1-inch PVC pipe cut to between 3 and 4 feet (0.9 and 1.2 meters) could work as a make-shift lightsaber, Mylett said. But using anything that weighs more could potentially be dangerous, he said.  (Even moving at 50 percent speed, there's still a chance you could get whacked, he added.)\nBut for padawans and Jedi alike, \na bright LED\n to simulate the lightsaber \"really adds fun, excitement and that geek factor that makes saber dueling so awesome,\" Mylett said. \nFollow Sara G.

[\n6 Flu Vaccine Myths\n]\nOn the other hand, there's a 57 percent chance that flu season will peak in February. That would be relatively late — the last three flu seasons have all peaked in December, said Dave Osthus, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory who leads the flu forecast project.\nThe new model also predicts that this flu season will be mild, meaning there will be fewer flu cases than in a typical flu season.\nThe main reason for this prediction is that \"historically, earlier-peaking flu seasons have tended to be more intense...

The two heads of government also had an unscheduled meeting at the Paris climate change talks earlier this month.\nSince gaining independence from Britain in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir, the Himalayan region that both countries claim.\nModi landed on Friday afternoon in the eastern city of Lahore and met with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, state-run media reported.

Earlier in the day, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Qazi Khalilullah said India had informed Pakistan about the visit on Friday. He refused to share any further details.\nOne of the first public signs of the visit came Friday morning when Modi, during a stop in the Afghan capital of Kabul, tweeted that he is \"looking forward to meeting\" Sharif in Lahore, \"where I will drop by on my way back to Delhi.\" He said he also called Sharif and wished him happy birthday.\nSharif's sprawling residence had been colorfully decorated for his granddaughter's wedding reception when Modi arrived along with the Pakistani prime minister. The two leaders were later shown sitting together in a room looking happy and relaxed.\nAnalysts viewed the visit as a potential turning point in Pakistani-Indian relations.\n\"I think it is going to play a significant role in improving ties between the two South Asian archrivals,\" said Amanullah Memon, a professor of international relations at Preston University in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.\nAmitabh Matto, an Indian foreign policy expert, described Modi's birthday diplomacy visit as a \"very positive step.\"\n\"Any step toward trying to stabilize and provide a new beginning to India-Pakistan ties is welcome and needs to be supported by all those who believe that India and Pakistan have a common destiny and it is in their interest to fight together their common problems, including terrorism and economic under-development,\" he said.\nTarun Vijay, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata party, praised Modi's visit as a sign of statesmanship. \"This is the best Christmas gift to the mankind which believes in peace and amity. He has risen to the commanding heights of being a statesman who can take a bold step surprising his friends and foes but melting ice in the relations,\" Vijay said\nAfter a year of rising tensions, top security officials from India and Pakistan held talks in Thailand's capital earlier in December, discussing a range of issues, including Kashmir and ways to maintain peace along the countries' shared border. Also, two weeks ago, Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Pakistan to attend a meeting on Afghanistan.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of arming and training insurgents fighting for Kashmir's independence from India or its merger with Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. More than 68,000 people have been killed in ongoing Kashmir violence, which began in 1989.\nA cease-fire along the so-called \"line of control\" that serves as the border between Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmir has largely held since 2003, but cross-border firing and minor skirmishes are fairly common, with each side routinely blaming the other.\nMirwaiz Umar Farooq, a key separatist leader in the Indian portion of Kashmir, said: \"It's a welcome step. We hope that it is followed by a consistent policy of engagement to resolve the Kashmir dispute. India and Pakistan have to evolve a mechanism to involve the core party to the issue — that is the Kashmiri people.\"\nIndia also wants Pakistan to bring to justice Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed 168 people. Saeed lives openly in Pakistan and often appears on TV interviews; the government claims it lacks the evidence to charge him.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this report.\n"}

[\n6 Flu Vaccine Myths\n]\nOn the other hand, there's a 57 percent chance that flu season will peak in February. That would be relatively late — the last three flu seasons have all peaked in December, said Dave Osthus, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory who leads the flu forecast project.\nThe new model also predicts that this flu season will be mild, meaning there will be fewer flu cases than in a typical flu season.\nThe main reason for this prediction is that \"historically, earlier-peaking flu seasons have tended to be more intense... [and] later-peaking seasons tend to be more mild,\" Osthus told Live Science.\nBut Osthus cautioned that there is still a lot that scientists don't know about \npredicting flu seasons\n — factors such as holiday travel and the rate at which people get flu shots could change the predictions. The researchers plan to update their predictions every two weeks during the 2015-2016 flu season and, at the end of the flu season, assess how well their model did, Osthus said.\nThe researchers will also continue to tweak their model to improve the predictions. For example, they plan to update the model to take into account how well the flu shot matches the strains of flu in circulation. The model will also incorporate \nWikipedia searches for flu\n, which has been shown in previous research to help predict flu outbreaks.\nDr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist and a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Center for Health Security, who was not involved with the study, said that predictions for flu season can help people plan for the coming season. For example, a later start to flu season means there is more time for people to get vaccinated before flu activity picks up.\n\"A prediction [of a late flu season] could sway somebody that's been delaying\" vaccination, Adalja said.\nHowever, Adalja said that mild flu seasons can still cause a substantial number of illnesses. \"Even a mild season of influenza is still a substantial burden,\" Adalja said. \"Every season … kills thousands of Americans.\"\nOsthus agreed. \"Even though we're anticipating a milder flu season, we still highly recommend that everyone go and get their \nflu shot\n,\" Osthus said. He also noted that the term \"mild season\" refers to how many people get sick with the illness, and not how severe the flu will be for an individual person.\nFollow Rachael Rettner \n@RachaelRettner\n.

The \ninfant's remains\n, which were found in what appears to be a birchbark cradle, suggest he or she was less than a year old at death. On the infant's chest, archaeologists found \"eight miniature horn figurines representing humanlike characters and heads of birds, elk, boar and a carnivore,\"wrote archaeologists Andrey Polyakov and Yury Esin, in an article published recently in the journal Archaeology, Ethnology & Anthropology of Eurasia.\nThe intricately carved figurines were likely made from deer antlers and have traces of red paint on them. \"Some of [the figurines] have internal cavities and, upon coming in contact with each other, could produce noisy sounds like modern rattles,\" wrote Polyakov, of the Institute for the History of Material Culture in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Esin, of the Khakassian Research Institute of Language, Literature and History. [\nImages: Abandoned Baby's Bones in Ancient Tuscany\n]\nThe figurines would have been attached in some way to the cradle, the researchers say. They could have functioned as toys and may also have protected the infant from \nevil powers\n. \"Various apotropaic charms are a necessary element of cradle decoration in the traditional cultures,\" Polyakov and Esin wrote.\nArchaeologists cannot rule out the possibility that the figurines have \"no relation to the cradle, and [were] placed into the burial to ensure successful transition of the deceased child to the next world,\" they wrote.\nHeadgear\nThe infant also had some interesting headgear. The infant's head was turned toward the southwest, and, on the skull, archaeologists found 11 small copper plaques, 10 of which were made from a thin oval copper plate no more than a half inch (1.5 centimeters) across, the archaeologists said.\nEach of the plaques had two fastening holes, where thin leather laces would've been threaded through to attach them to one another. The cap could then be placed on the infant's head. Remains of those laces were also found in the burial.\nOne of the plaques, located at the top of the infant's headgear, was made of two metallic cones that would have been sewn together. \"Probably these were adornments of the child's cap,\" Polyakov and Esin wrote. They note that an earring was also found to the left of the infant's skull.\nThe infant's people\nThe infant was buried along with several other people in \na burial mound called a kurgan\n. The people buried in the mound were part of what modern-day archaeologists call the Okunev culture.\nAlthough writing had not yet spread to this part of the world, \"the Okunev people had mastered processing of copper and bronze manufacture from which they cast blades, daggers, axes and spear-heads, fishing hooks and other tools and ornaments,\" Esin told Live Science in an email. In addition to metal, these people continued to use tools made of stone and bone, Esin added.\n\"People who were buried in this kurgan were early herders. We have images of \ndomesticated animals\n (especially bulls), carts and wagons in Okunev rock art,\"  Esin wrote.\nThe Okunev people may have venerated anthropomorphic [part-human and part-animal] deities. \"In my view the anthropomorphic images in Okunev art could represent deities.

As it turns out, the real-life animal named after this mythical beast may be even more tenacious.\nA new study finds that hydra — spindly, freshwater polyps — can \nlive seemingly forever\n, without aging.\nUnlike most multicellular species, hydra don't show any signs of deteriorating with age, according to the new research, published Dec. 7 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [\nFrom Methuselah to Elves: The Top 10 Immortals\n]\n\"I started my original experiment wanting to prove that hydra could not have escaped aging,\" study researcher Daniel Martinez, a Pomona College biologist, \nsaid in a statement\n. \"My own data has proven me wrong — twice.\"\nLiving forever\nHydra are a group of invertebrates that look like tiny tubes with tentacles protruding off one end. They grow only about 0.4 inches (10 millimeters) long and eat even tinier aquatic animals.\nHydra are known for their regenerative capabilities. Most of their body cells are \nstem cells\n, Martinez said. These cells are capable of continuous division and differentiation into any cell type in the body. In humans, such \"totipotent\" cells are present only in the first few days of embryonic development. Hydra, by contrast, constantly renew their bodies with fresh cells.\nIn 1998, Martinez and his colleagues published a study describing how they found no signs of aging in mature hydras over four years. To detect aging, researchers look at senescence, which is defined as an increased rate of death and a decline in fertility with greater age. In that 1998 study, researchers couldn't pin down whether or not hydra fertility declined with age.\nThe new research involved creating little islands of paradise for 2,256 hydras. The researchers wanted to give the animals ideal conditions, which meant giving each an individual dish, with the water changed thrice weekly, plus meals of fresh brine shrimp.\nOver eight years, the researchers found no evidence of senescence in their coddled hydra. Death rates held constant at one per 167 hydras per year, no matter their age. (The \"oldest\" animals studied were clones of hydras that had been around for 41 years — though individuals were only studied for eight years, some were biologically older because they were genetic clones.)  Likewise, fertility remained constant for 80 percent of the individual hydras over time. The other 20 percent fluctuated up and down, likely because of laboratory conditions.\n\"I do believe that an individual hydra can \nlive forever\n under the right circumstances,\" Martinez said.\nIn the wild, disease, predators and water contamination kill off hydras before they can achieve immortality. But the findings fly in the face of old models that assumed that all animals must decline with age, Martinez said. And that means that studying hydra could help scientists unravel the mystery of why \nmost animals do age\n.\n\"I’m hoping this work helps sparks another scientist to take a deeper look at immortality,\" Martinez said, \"perhaps in some other organism that helps bring more light to the mysteries of aging.”\nFollow Stephanie Pappas on \nTwitter\nand \nGoogle+\n.

The new explanation could explain everything from the quake-prone faults of Southern California to dynamic crust beneath the snow-capped peak of K2 in the Himalayas.\nThe theory is deceptively simple: When two faults collide, instead of one breaking past another, they may just merge, like a zipper zipping up, said John Platt, a geologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, here at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. [\nPhoto Journal: The Gorgeous San Andreas Fault\n]\n\"It may solve some long-standing and intractable problems concerning the timing and displacement on faults,\" Platt said in the presentation.\nStrange rocks\nPlatt and his colleague Cees Passchier, a technophysicist at the University of Mainz in Germany, were looking at a strange rock formation called Cap de Creus in Spain. To a geologist's eyes, the rocks make no sense, with rocks on one side of the fault showing signs of shear in one direction and those on the other side having the opposite shear orientation. Normally, the direction of motion revealed in the rocks should be the same on either side of the fault. (At Cap de Creus, the textural lines in the rocks make a \"V\" shape around the fault, while normally that texture would look more like diagonal lines that cross the fault.)\nPasschier \"showed it to me in the field; it just blew my mind. I thought 'There's just no way, it's completely impossible,'\" Platt told Live Science.\nBut seeing Cap de Creus got him thinking about another fault junction closer to home. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Los Angeles, in a little mountain town called Gorman, the \nSan Andreas Fault\n collides with the Garlock Fault, which then heads east into the Mojave Desert. (The San Andreas Fault formed 30 million years ago when the North American and Pacific plates first met and began to slide past each other, forming a \nstrike-slip fault\n that snakes about 800 miles (1,287 km) north along the California coast, from the Salton Sea to the Mendocino Coast.)\nBased on traditional conceptions of faults, either the Garlock Fault should have cut through the San Andreas Fault and deactivated it, or vice versa. But the San Andreas Fault has about 150 miles (241 km) of slip between either side, meaning that volcanic rocks in \nPinnacles National Park\n match those much farther south, in Los Angeles County. The Garlock Fault, by contrast, has 18 miles (30 km) of slip.\nSo if the San Andreas Fault had cut the Garlock Fault, it should have offset the Garlock Fault by a whopping 150 miles (241 km), deactivating it, and if the Garlock Fault had cut the San Andreas Fault, it would have shoved the San Andreas over by 18 miles (30 km). And yet clearly, neither has happened, and no one really thought to wonder why.\n\"It's a classic paradox,\" Platt said.\nSimple solution\nSo Platt wondered whether the two simply joined. In that case, the slip between the two would be added (in this case, because the two slip in opposite directions, the slip of one would be subtracted from the other.) The faults, in essence, would act more like a zipper being closed.\nWhen he and his colleagues thought about it, the concept of \"zipper faults\" could explain many of extremely confusing spots around the world. All told, the team came up with about 27 different versions of the zipper fault, depending on whether the junctions are \"unzipping\" or \"zipping,\" and whether the fault collisions include dextral, sinistral or wedge faults. (In this instance, sinistral means leftward, while dextral means rightward.)\nFor instance, the Altyn-Tagh and Karakoram faults, which sit on the Tibetan plateau, have long inspired furious debate among plate tectonics researchers, because rocks on either side of each fault make the resulting slip difficult to reconcile. For instance, some have suggested that the \nKarakoram Fault\n moved as much as 30 mm per year, whereas others said the fault moved just 3 mm a year. [\nThe World's Tallest Mountains\n]\n\"You wouldn't believe the arguments about those faults,\" Platt said.\nScientists could go to the region to see if zippering could explain the confusing rocks, though it's difficult to survey in the region because of the forbidding terrain, he said.\nPlatt noted that earlier geologists have even used the word \"zipper\" to explain a few other faults, such as one in the \nAlps\n, but they never connected the dots to create a comprehensive theory.\nSimple but powerful\nOne way to test the idea is to place sophisticated \nglobal positioning system\n (GPS) devices around the faults to measure how much they are moving at a given time and see if they match with proposed slip based on the zipper model, he said. At the San Andreas/Garlock Fault intersection, the slip rate north of the junction should be less than that south of the intersection, if his zippering theory is correct.\n\"I really like it, the idea,\" said Ivanka Mitrovic, a geodynamics researcher at the National History Museum and the University of Vienna in Austria, who was not involved in the study but who attended the talk. The idea is \"very simple, but it's that simple brilliance,\" she said.\nIf the notion of zipper faults proves true, it \"would help connect opposing opinions,\" Mitrovic told Live Science.\nFollow Tia Ghose on \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n. Follow Live Science \n@livescience\n, \nFacebook\n & \nGoogle+\n.

She contributed this article to Live Science's \nExpert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights\n.\nThis fall I read \"\nThe Martian\n\" (Crown, 2014) by Andy Weir, and it made me want to be a scientist. I was drawn to Mark Watney, the main character, by his optimism, creativity and problem solving — which he maintained even in the face of the most dire conditions (it doesn't get any more dire than being left alone on Mars!). \nIt's because I share those three traits — optimism, creativity and problem solving — that I'm a product designer. But while science is about explaining the world and universe based on facts, my field is about imagining the world based on possibilities. Designers look at everyday products, services and experiences in new ways, and design to improve life. In doing so, we tag-team with engineers, who are indispensable to making our designs manufacturable and real.\nDesign for life\nIn my career, I've designed hundreds of products, from toilet seats to office systems to kitchen gadgets to pens. Some of my designs you might have already used, such as a potato peeler for Giada's collection at Target to the Herman Miller Resolve Office System you may be sitting in as you read this article. \nEven though the products vary greatly, the red thread across all of them is my design process — Deconstruction:Reconstruction. It helps me, and those around me, think differently and bring new solutions to old problems. Even problems in life.\n\"\nDesign the Life You Love\n\" started as an experiment. I think that people's lives are their biggest design projects — full of constraints, challenges, and opposing needs and wants — and I wanted to see if I could apply my process and tools to living. You simply cannot have everything. If you want to have more, you need to make what you want and what you need co-exist. This requires that you think like a designer.\nI fell in love with the human scale of design when I was 16. A family friend came to tea and asked me if I knew what product design was. I didn't. Using a teacup, he explained to me that the edge of the cup is curved to better fit people's lips, the handle is to help people hold hot liquid in their hands and the saucer is there so that if I spilled some of my tea, I wouldn't ruin my mom's tablecloth. \nDesign 101 for scientists\nSince I often work closely with engineers, I've come to realize that the design process has uncanny similarity to the scientific and engineering processes, yet it differs in key ways. By understanding the design process I use, everyone, including scientists, can gain insight into solving complex problems that they might want to think differently about … including how to live a complete life.\nHere are a few simple steps to help you tackle challenges like a designer:\n00. Warm up:\nDraw something to warm up your right brain (if you wonder about the difference between the right and left brains, here is a great \narticle\n). You might say as a scientist that you don't draw. Come on! Everyone draws. It doesn't have to be masterpiece. Just rest your eyes on something — a flower, a mug, a cat or a person (you can use the template below if you're drawing a person) and draw for 3 minutes. There, now you just sent a signal to your brain that you're going to think creatively. [\nThe Roots of Creativity Found in the Brain\n ]\n01. Deconstruction:\nDeconstruction is breaking the whole apart to see what it's made of. You can even deconstruct something very familiar, like science, to see what goes into it. Here is my deconstruction of science across the four quadrants of emotion, physical reality, intellect and spirit (the four quadrants tool is one I use to think holistically).\n02. Point of View:\nPeople can shift their points of view intentionally. As this beloved Shakespeare quote says, \"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" In design, you want to shift from what you know to what you can imagine. I have gathered a couple of tools over time to help shift my perspective from what I know to what I can imagine. My favorite is the metaphor. You can use metaphors to help think about difficult subjects through the lens of something you know. One of my favorite STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) projects is STEAM Carnival by Two Bit Circus, which uses the metaphor of a traveling, high-tech carnival to teach people, young and old, about science. Imagine being inside the Dunk Tank Flambé, which spouts out flames instead of water when a player hits the target with a softball, engulfing in this case my friend John Zapolski in fire. Luckily for John, he is wearing a super-flame-retardant suit. Image is courtesy of photodepot.com and Two Bit Circus.\n03. Reconstruction:\nReconstruction is the other side of Deconstruction. It is about putting the subject back together again, knowing that you cannot have everything. Design is about making choices, and the three circles above symbolize your constraints. What are the three essential components of your new idea, the ones to which you will devote your time and energy? And what new value do they create together?\n04. Expression:\nExpression is giving your idea form. You build on the foundation of your new idea, and you express it as a unique prototype, a product, a strategy, a mathematical formula or a hypothesis. \nThis approach is about making design process and tools accessible, especially to nondesigners, around a project everyone shares: In life, people can solve problems with creativity and optimism. [\nDitching Gadgets May Boost Creativity\n ]\nWhich brings us back to Mars. Even if I cannot go to Mars tomorrow, I would love to work with amazingly creative scientists and engineers to bring design and science together to generate solutions for old (and new) problems. I really want to learn how to think more like a scientist. That would be the best of STEAM: I bring the \"A\" of Arts and Design, and you bring STEM, and together we do our best left- and right-brain thinking. That would be a dream come true, a life well-designed — perhaps on Mars?\nFollow all of the Expert Voices issues and debates — and become part of the discussion — on \nFacebook\n, \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n.

Takeshi Onaga told a news conference in the prefectural capital of Naha. \"Okinawa's argument is legitimate, and I believe that it will be certainly understood.\"\nThe central government filed its own lawsuit against Onaga last month, after he rejected an order from the Land Ministry to reinstate approval, issued by his predecessor, for the land reclamation. The ministry went ahead with the reclamation work.\n\"We'll proceed with the construction to achieve the planned relocation as soon as possible,\" Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said in Tokyo.\nThe legal battle is the latest chapter in a long-running dispute between the central government and Okinawa, formerly a tiny kingdom that was annexed by Japan in the 16th century.\nMany residents want the U.S. base moved out of Okinawa entirely. They have been long frustrated by heavy U.S. troop presence on the tiny island and have complained about noise, pollution and crime associated with the foreign bases.\nUnder a Japan-U.S. security treaty, about 50,000 American troops are stationed in Japan, more than half of them on Okinawa.\nOnaga said Okinawa's burden is out of proportion, and hoped the legal battle will help raise awareness of the problem.\n\"Democracy and local self-determination in Japan are in severe condition,\" Onaga said. \"We want the rest of the world to know how the Japan-U.S. security treaty is affecting us.\" Okinawa was under U.S. occupation for 27 years after Japan's World War II defeat, and today it is the Japanese government that is forcing the unwanted relocation, he said.\nTokyo says the current relocation site is the only possibility.\nOnaga was elected last year, widely supported by voters who feel Okinawa bears an unfair burden of the U.S. military presence. His anti-base stance has also made residents of Okinawa, an island with a distinct culture, more aware of their identity.\nSome critics of the landfill plan also object to potential environmental damage to the previously undeveloped Henoko shore.\n___\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/mari-yamaguchi\n"}

Das and Mehreen Zahra-Malik\nNEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise stopover in Pakistan on Friday to meet his counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, the first time an Indian premier has visited the rival nation in over a decade.\nSharif hugged Modi after he landed at the airport in the eastern city of Lahore, state television showed. A spokesman at the Pakistani prime minister's office told Reuters the two leaders would discuss a range of bilateral issues, including the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.\nModi was on his way home after a visit to Russia. He stopped off in the Afghanistan capital Kabul earlier on Friday.\nModi and Sharif resumed high-level contacts with a brief conversation at climate change talks in Paris late last month, part of efforts to restart a peace dialogue plagued by militant attacks and long-standing distrust between the nuclear-armed rivals.\nModi, who inaugurated a new parliament complex built with Indian help in Kabul, spoke to Sharif earlier on Friday to wish him on his 66th birthday.\n\"Looking forward to meeting PM Nawaz Sharif in Lahore today afternoon, where I will drop by on my way back to Delhi,\" Modi tweeted.\nA close aide to Modi said it was a spontaneous decision taken by the prime minister and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and that it should not be seen as a sudden shift in India's position.\n\"But yes, it's a clear signal that active engagement can be done at a quick pace,\" the aide said, declining to be identified.\nMistrust between India and Pakistan runs deep and in Afghanistan many believe that Islamabad sponsors the Taliban insurgency to weaken the Kabul government and limit the influence of India.\nPakistan rejects the accusation but it has struggled to turn around perceptions in Afghanistan, where social media users sent out a stream of glowing commentary on Modi's visit, contrasting the parliament building with the destruction wrought by Taliban suicide bombers.\nNalin Kohli, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, said in New Delhi that India was ready to take two steps forward if Pakistan took one to improve ties. The countries have fought three wars since 1947, two of them over Kashmir, the divided Himalayan territory that both countries claim in full.\nThe opposition Congress Party called Modi's visit irresponsible and said that nothing had happened to warrant warming of ties between the rivals. Scheduled high-level talks between the two were canceled in August after ceasefire violations across the border.\n\"If the decision is not preposterous then it is utterly ridiculous,\" Congress leader Manish Tewari said.\nKABUL COMPETITION\nOpening the parliament building in Kabul, Modi pledged India's support for the Afghan government and urged regional powers, including Pakistan, to work together to foster peace.\nThe building is the latest symbol of a longstanding diplomatic effort by New Delhi to cultivate links with Afghanistan.\nAs well as the parliament building, India is also supplying three Russian-made Mi-35 helicopters to Afghanistan's small air force, adding badly needed capacity to provide close air support to its hard-pressed security forces.\nWithout referring directly to Pakistan, Modi said that some had seen \"sinister designs in our presence\" in Afghanistan.\n\"India is here to contribute, not to compete; to lay the foundation of the future, not light the flame of conflict,\" he told lawmakers in Kabul, adding that Afghanistan could never \"serve the designs of others\".\nModi said regional support would be vital for peace in Afghanistan.\n\"We know that Afghanistan's success will require the cooperation and support of each of its neighbors,\" he said. \"And all of us in the region - India, Pakistan, Iran and others – must unite in trust and cooperation behind the common purpose and in recognition of our common destiny.\"\n(Additional reporting by James Mackenzie in KABUL, Rupam Jain Nair and Sankalp Phartiyal in NEW DELHI; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n"}

Arellano was 40 when he disappeared.\nOfficers spent days searching rugged desert canyons and caves for Arellano after identifying him as the suspect in the shooting of Utah park ranger Brody Young.\nYoung, who was 34 at the time, survived the shooting with injuries to his arm, leg and abdomen. A message seeking comment from Young on Thursday night was not immediately returned.\nGary Lewis, a manager of Young's motivational speaking business, said police contacted Young seeking help identifying the remains.\nYoung and his family would not be commenting, Lewis said, citing the holidays. He noted that the Christmas Eve discovery also marked the five-year anniversary of the day Young returned home from the hospital.\nYoung still works for Utah State Parks in the agency's boating safety program.\n\"He's made a complete recovery but he still carries around four bullets,\" Lewis said.\nThe Grand County Sheriff's Office said a college student discovered the remains in the cave. Nearby was a bag containing a handgun, ammunition and binoculars.\nThe sheriff's office said the student, Caleb Shumway, was specifically searching the area for Arellano.\nShumway, a 23-year-old Utah Valley University student, told The Associated Press than he and his 15-year-old brother had decided to spend two weeks over winter break searching for Arellano — a mission their police officer father helped with five years earlier. An outstanding $30,000 reward for Arellano was part of the draw, Shumway said.\n\"For a poor college student, that's pretty appealing,\" he said.\nShumway added that resolving the case was a big thing for the Moab community. \"There's lots of closure that would come with finding this guy because no one really knew if he was dead or alive,\" he explained.\nShumway, an Eagle Scout who grew up exploring caves and canyons in the area, said he was confident he could find Arellano's body after studying the case and discussing the search area with his father.\n\"I kind of had a good idea of what had happened,\" he said.\nHe and his brother were two days into their search when they discovered a bone and the bag with the gun near the mouth of a cave on Wednesday.\nShumway hopped down and under boulders and took pictures. Then they met with police Thursday and took officers back out to the site. They found more skeletal remains, clothing and another backpack with another gun deeper in the cave.\nShumway believes the first bone and bag he spotted had been recently dragged to the cave's mouth by an animal. He was still awaiting word on whether he would get the reward.\nAuthorities said evidence left with the remains led investigators to believe it was Arellano, but they did not offer further details.\nThe remains will be sent to the state medical examiner to be identified.\nMessages seeking further details from Grand County Sheriff Steven White were not immediately returned.\nYoung was shot when he approached Arrellano in his car near the Poison Spider Mesa Trailhead on Nov. 19, 2010, according to authorities. Young told Arrellano that he was in a no-camping area, and when he attempted to verify the man's name and birthdate, he was shot several times in the back, authorities said.\nPolice believed Arrellano may have been injured as Young returned fire.\nMore than 160 law enforcement officers combed a 15-squre mile area near Dead Horse State Park. They recovered a rifle, backpack and tattered bloody T-shirt.\nProsecutors had filed first-degree felony attempted murder and other charges against Arrellano.\n___\nFollow Michelle L.

Expectations for Jindal soared after his decisive win and a campaign built on reform.\nBut many now see Jindal as a disappointment. The governor's approval ratings have fallen to 30 percent or less in recent polls.\n\"When I talked to people, they saw a guy who seemed to be a whole lot more interested in his personal ambitions than he was in them. And I think that's how he's going to be remembered,\" said term-limited state Sen. Robert Adley, R-Benton.\n\"Certainly he has accomplishments. But anytime the public thinks you put yourself above them, everything else goes away,\" Adley said.\nJindal counts among his biggest achievements the privatization of the LSU charity hospital system; the expansion of charter schools and vouchers; and $62 billion in economic development wins estimated to create tens of thousands of new jobs.\nImmediately after taking office, the governor worked to improve the state's image with an overhaul of ethics laws. He cut business taxes and revamped worker training programs, and he poured millions into direct incentives to draw companies to Louisiana.\n\"He's one of the best governors arguably the state's ever had as far as economic development,\" said lumber company owner Roy O. Martin, a Jindal donor and one of the governor's appointees to the Board of Regents.\nJindal describes his key initiatives in ethics, education and economic development as aimed at keeping Louisiana's children from having to leave the state to pursue their dreams.\n\"Eight years ago, the challenge was we were losing our sons and daughters. Now, one of our big challenges is we've got to train enough people to fill these skilled jobs,\" Jindal said.\nBut the achievements have been drowned out by constant budget challenges.\nWhen he took office, Jindal inherited a more than $1 billion state surplus. Then, a national recession, Jindal's backing of the largest individual income tax cut in state history and the ballooning costs of tax breaks siphoned money from the treasury. Plummeting oil and gas prices worsened the hit.\nBacked by lawmakers, the governor stripped $700 million in state financing from higher education and chipped away at funding for programs across state government. But he refused to support anything he considered a tax increase and used patchwork maneuvers to pay for government programs.\nJindal defends his management of the state's finances, saying the state received credit upgrades on his watch. He said he decided to grow the private sector economy rather than the government and counts as an achievement the reduction of more than 30,000 state workers.\n\"I think the approach we took was absolutely right,\" Jindal said. \"We held the line on taxes. We were willing to cut government.\"\nJindal disagrees with suggestions that budget cuts — or his presidential ambitions — took a toll on his approval ratings with voters, insisting the nosedive is tied to a 2012 education revamp that rankled teacher unions and public school leaders.\nBut Baton Rouge pollster Bernie Pinsonat, who has tracked the governor's approval ratings, disagrees that education was Jindal's weak spot with voters.\nPeople \"didn't think that their governor should not be in the state when we can't afford to fund education and health care properly, and it really turned voters off,\" he said. \"The more he traveled, the more he campaigned out of state, the more his popularity fell.\"\n___\nFollow Melinda Deslatte at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte .\n"}

In most people the two-component gene does not work. But in a small percentage the gene functions and puts its possessors at increased risk for lupus and potentially other autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues, says a team of researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nIf the Birmingham researchers are right, the gene could be a clue to improving therapy for autoimmune diseases. At least one prominent researcher has roundly criticized the putative lupus link, however.\nIn a paper published December 18 in Science Translational Medicine, the Alabama researchers said that working copies of the fused gene disrupt a tidy feedback loop that the immune system uses to regulate the production of antibodies—molecules that are key players in immune responses to disease-causing microorganisms.\nIn many autoimmune disorders antibodies run amok, targeting not invading microbes, but a person’s organs. Cells known as B lymphocytes, or B cells, secrete the antibodies, and so the B cells make an attractive target for therapies to control autoimmune conditions. Many scientists have focused specifically on manipulating a molecule on B cells that, when bound by antibodies, normally tells the B cells, “Stop! No more antibodies!” In a healthy immune system, activation of this molecule—known as Fc gamma RIIb, or the IIb receptor for short—makes antibody production self-limiting: more antibodies means that more B cells close the antibody tap.\nThe Alabama team found that, when functional, the Reese’s Cup gene causes B cells to manufacture a previously undetected molecule—Fc gamma RIIc. When that molecule is activated by an antibody it countermands the IIb stop order, telling B cells to secrete more antibodies. In people with the fusion gene that encodes the IIc receptor molecule, antibodies are just as likely to engage IIc as IIb and thus induce B cells to overproduce antibodies. \"We believe this is going to change the way people think about feedback and B cells,\" Robert Kimberly, co-author of the Science Translational Medicine paper, told Scientific American in a telephone interview.. \"The way feedback is depicted in the textbook is incomplete.\"\nThe researchers demonstrated the contrarian role of the IIc molecules in studies of both mice and in human and mouse cells in culture. When mice B cells, which don't normally make the IIc molecule, were genetically altered to produce IIc, they generated more antibodies than the B cells of unaltered littermates. Human B cells that had at least one copy of the functioning fusion gene expressed the IIc molecule. Further, the researchers reported, people who carried two copies of the gene that makes IIc had an early immune response to an anthrax vaccine that was two and a half times greater than those without the IIc molecule. Because the vaccine induced antibody production, the rise was another a sign that IIc amps up antibody production. To make the link to IIc and lupus, the researchers compared the genetic profiles of 1,425 people with lupus with the same number without and found that those with the working copies of the IIc-encoding gene had at a 20 percent increased odds of contracting lupus—a risk factor the researchers said was equivalent to other established genetic effects for lupus. “Up until now, it was assumed—going back decades—that there was only a brake on the B cell,” Kimberly says. “But the expression of IIc counterbalances that brake and gives the B cell a feed-forward signal rather than a feedback.”\nHow is it that the fused gene is silent in most people but gives rise to the feed-forward IIc receptor in some? Usually, the Reese’s Cup gene includes three nucleotides—DNA code letters—that serve as a stop sign, preventing the gene from making the IIc receptor molecule. But in 7 to 15 percent of the population a change in a single nucleotide of this stop sign eliminates its inhibitory effect.\nThe receptor was not discovered in B cells before, Kimberly says, because the part of it that lies outside the B cell membrane is identical to the IIb receptor. Only the intracellular part of this membrane-spanning protein, which tells the cell how to respond to antibody binding, differs. This difference explains why antibodies can bind readily to both receptors, but with opposite results.\nBut Jeffrey Ravetch, the Rockefeller University researcher who discovered the existence of Fc receptors and has spent the last several decades characterizing them, says the Science Translational Medicine paper proves nothing. “It’s technically flawed. The conclusions that they draw are not supported by the data they show. It’s lacking controls,” Ravetch told Scientific American in a telephone interview. He criticized nearly every method the researchers used, including the kinds of cells examined in cell-culture studies and the “on switch” the researchers used to activate the genes encoding Fc receptors in laboratory mice as well as the lack of quantitative data showing the amount of gene activity. “If you want to take a swing at the fences, you’d better be prepared to defend yourself,” Ravetch says. “As the authors are well aware, this is a topic for drug development, and those are very important efforts looking at endogenous brakes on the immune system to rein in uncontrolled immune response. If you’re going to take that swing, you want to get it right.”\nKimberly disagrees with Ravetch's objection, saying both the mouse and human data was quantitative, and noted that because mice don't make the IIc receptor, it was impossible to use the mouse's own \"on switch\" to activate the receptor, as Ravetch contends.\nIf the Alabama team’s result holds up, it could, they say, help to explain not only why some people overproduce antibodies that are bad for them, but also why some with autoimmune disorder do not respond to treatments meant to bind to and activate the inhibitory IIb receptors. If the drugs also activate IIc receptors, they could pump up antibody production as much as they dampened it. “There are always patients who don’t respond to any therapy,” says Jeffrey Edberg, a co-author on the paper. “That’s been one of the biggest issues in the field—to try to figure out why some people respond and others don’t.”\nBut whether the work will end up helping people with autoimmune disorders remains an open question. Bassil Dahiyat, president and CEO of Xencor, which has engineered antibodies to interact with the IIb receptor, points out that in studies of patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis the company has so far seen nothing to indicate that its engineered antibodies are causing B cells to make more antibodies. Rather, across the board, they see strong B cell suppression, he notes.\nStill, if IIc receptor does play a role in B cell antibody production, then testing for its activity could potentially help Xencor and other gene therapy companies that are targeting B cells determine the best candidates for treatment with their products.\n“Wouldn’t it be fantastic if we could see which patients would respond to different drugs?” Dahiyat says. That would be an important tool, he adds. “It’s fantastic to see these pieces come together.”\nFollow \nScientific American\n on Twitter \n@SciAm\n and \n@SciamBlogs\n.\nVisit \nScientificAmerican.com\n for the latest in science, health and technology news.\n© 2014 \nScientificAmerican.com\n.

In parallel, blood CD4+ T cell numbers dip precipitously after initial HIV infection and only rebound partially before beginning a steady and inexorable decline. This death of CD4+ T cells over the ensuing years leads to progressive immune deficiency, and thus AIDS.\nHIV-1 particles assembling at the surface of an infected macrophage\nIn AIDS, the loss of CD4+ T cells – and the immunological disarray this creates – renders people with HIV susceptible to opportunistic infections otherwise unknown in those with healthy immunity. Without treatment, a third of AIDS patients develop pneumonia from a ubiquitous fungus called Pneumocystis. The virus cytomegalovirus leads to the development of blind spots and then complete blindness in one eye before savaging the sight of the other eye. Inflamed pockets of brain infection by the cat parasite Toxoplasma gondii cause focal weakness and other neurological defects.\nThese and other cardinal manifestations of AIDS have been known \nsince 1981\n when doctors first reported new and perplexing cases of opportunistic infections among gay men in the coastal United States. What has eluded full explication until recently is how HIV infection causes this progressive death of CD4+ T cells.\nOne reasonable assumption early on would have been that HIV caused the death of CD4+ T cells via direct infection of CD4+ T cells. Many viruses like influenza and poliovirus cause \nlysis\n of their human host cells either through direct viral toxicity or mediated by vigorous host immune efforts to kill infected cells.\nYet a conundrum emerged early in the effort to understand AIDS pathogenesis: only a minority of CD4+ T cells are actively infected by HIV – usually fewer than five percent – so why did so many CD4+ T cells die if so few were actively infected?\nUntil recently, the best explanation for this paradoxical finding was that \nchronic immune activation\n associated with HIV infection was killing CD4+ T cells. It was already known that unquenched HIV infection is accompanied by chronic immune activation in which an unending flurry of cytokine release stimulates cellular proliferation and antibody production. During this process, wave after wave of immune cells are recruited to fight HIV, but all fail. Instead HIV rages on in lymph nodes and in the blood, calling forth still further waves of immune cells in an ultimately futile and ever-weaker attempt to contain HIV infection. The perpetual recruitment of immune cells into an ultimately futile fight against a ravaging virus – augmented by bloodstream leakage of pro-inflammatory bacterial products past the damaged gut immunological barrier – came with a huge cost: wave after wave of CD4+ T cell death.\nThe massive losses of vital CD4+ T cell defenders against the HIV invasion appeared, at least early on, to result from a coopted normal immunological housekeeping mechanism: \napoptosis\n. Apoptosis is programmed death of cells whose utility has waned. Imagine contracting an upper respiratory tract infection from a rhinovirus or some other cause of the common cold. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and other immune cells migrate to the mucosal lining of the sinuses and other airway tissues to eliminate this rhinoviral invader, getting killed in the process of pitched immunological battle and as a result being extruded from the body in the form of snot. In a few days, the rhinoviral invader has been repelled, and the utility of these cellular defenders comes to an end unless a lifelong runny nose is desired. The most expeditious way to extinguish the immunological fire, then, is via activation-induced cell death, in which responder immune cells are preprogrammed to undergo apoptosis, thus clearing the mucosal battlefield and making way for good health to return. AIDS pathogenesis was felt to hijack this normal process because wave after wave of ineffectual CD4+ T cell responses to HIV infection would lead to CD4+ T cell apoptosis followed by recruitment of new CD4+ T cells which in turn would die, and so on.\nEnter Warner Greene, a dapper white-haired professor of medicine at UCSF and its Gladstone Institute of Virology. In a feat of scientific hutzpah sure to trigger fits of envy among other scientific heavy-hitters, Greene shattered the existing model of AIDS pathogenesis in two simultaneous groundbreaking articles in the prestigious journals \nScience\n and \nNature\n in late December 2013.\nGreene’s team made multiple seminal observations. Their key findings were:\nAbortive infection of CD4+ T cells by HIV virions – in which HIV enters the CD4+ T cell cytosol but then accumulates incomplete viral transcripts which cannot establish a productive replication cycle – is detected by a host DNA sensor called interferon-gamma-inducible protein 16, or IFI16;\nIFI16 (and potentially other sensors of abortive HIV infection) triggers an intense inflammatory process of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis, known as pyroptosis;\nPyroptosis leads to release of intracellular contents as well as inflammatory cytokines into the extracellular milieu thus plausibly contributing to chronic immune activation;\nThe pyroptosis caused by widespread abortive HIV infection of CD4+ T cells is mediated in part by the intracellular enzyme caspase-1; and,\nPharmaceutical blockade of caspase-1 safely precluded HIV-mediated pyroptosis of CD4+ T cells.\nAnd thus our model of AIDS pathogenesis is revised once again. While clearly chronic immune activation contributes to the loss of CD4+ T cells and AIDS pathogenesis, Greene and colleagues explain this process in an entirely novel way. Instead of chronic immune activation serving in a leading role during AIDS pathogenesis, chronic immune activation is recast in a supporting role, becoming itself a bystander to the real culprit, abortive HIV infection of CD4+ T cells.\nThese findings topple our conception of how HIV causes death among millions each year. They also have concrete clinical import. By demonstrating that caspase-1 inhibitors can block pyroptosis and thus a critical step in AIDS pathogenesis, Greene and colleagues breathe new life into the global effort to fight AIDS. Modern \nanti-HIV therapy\n has restored decades of life to the millions who can access it, but despite these successes current anti-HIV treatments do not wholly rectify chronic immune activation, restore full immunological function nor stave off all of the non-infectious risks of HIV infection such as cancer. Greene and collaborators recently \nannounced\n a phase II human clinical trial testing the safety and potency of caspase-1 inhibitors in precluding HIV-associated pyroptosis. If safe, targeting capsase-1 mediated CD4+ T cell pyroptosis could help delay expensive anti-HIV therapy and/or augment anti-HIV therapy-mediated protection from the clinical manifestations of HIV and AIDS.\nNearly 33 years after clinicians first reported AIDS, we are still learning how HIV kills. The novel identification of a major role of pyroptosis in AIDS pathogenesis suggests novel therapeutic pathways and thus new hope in the fight against HIV.\nPhoto credit: Gross L (2006) Reconfirming the Traditional Model of HIV Particle Assembly.

{"title": "Pope issues Christmas indulgence to spread message of mercy", "appeartime": "1451051236.44", "comments": ["Did you know that both Ovomit and Hillary studies the book Rules for Radicles and Hillary wrote here college thesis on it? both follow this book religiously and if youo listen and watch ovomit, he is using every one of Alinskys principles in his own presidency.. Obama should be hung", "http://www.ourcatholicfaith.org/indulgences.html An indulgence is simply a remission through the infinite merits of Jesus Christ and His Saints of the temporal punishment due for sins committed after guilt and eternal punishment have been remitted. Sacred Scripture gives us an example of what is meant by \"temporal punishment.\" Mary, the sister of Moses, was forgiven by God for complaining against her brother. Nevertheless, despite such forgiveness, God imposed upon her the temporal punishment of leprosy and seven days exile from her people (Num. 12). A thief may be sorry for stealing a large sum of money from a gentleman, but he is still required to return the money taken and even do time in prison. That Our Lord has given the Church the power of granting indulgences is implied in Scripture: \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\" (St. Matt. 16, 19). St. Paul provides a clear example of the Church using this power with respect to the incestuous Corinthian upon whom he had imposed a severe penance. After learning of the Corinthian’s fervent sorrow St. Paul absolved him of the penance which he had imposed saying: \"For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ\" (2 Cor. 2, 10 [Douai]). In this example we have the elements of a true indulgence: (i) a penance (temporal punishment) imposed on the Corinthian by St. Paul; (ii) sorrow on the part of the sinner for his crime; (iii) the relaxation of the penance by St. Paul (the indulgence); (iv) the relaxation done in the \"person of Christ.\" Further, Catholics believe that many of the faithful throughout the centuries - virgins, martyrs, confessors, saints etc. - have performed penances and good works far in excess of what was due as temporal punishment for their own sins. Their merits, in union with the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, form a \"spiritual treasury\" which the Church can draw upon to assist other members of the Church in general or, in particular, pay the debt of temporal punishment both for the living and the dead: \"I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church\" (Col. 1, 24); \"For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ;...If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it\" (1 Cor. 12, 12-26). Therefore, by virtue of the Communion of Saints the faithful can assist each other with their prayers, masses, almsgivings to remit temporal punishment due to sin, most particularly, to offer mass for the deceased to remit temporal punishment due in purgatory.", "For a Happy Winter Solstice for your democrap friends, give them a copy of their Bible....Saul Alinskys book, Rules for Radicles", "I wouldn't praise the US in any fashion, the news just broke that we're planning a major \"round 'em up\" operation targeting Central and South American immigrants.

The sun-soaked St. Peter's Square was under heavy security, as it has been since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks by Islamic extremists that left 130 dead.\nAn indulgence is an ancient church tradition related to the forgiveness of sins. Francis announced it after delivering his annual \"Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world)\" speech listing global hotspots and his prayers for an end to human suffering.\nFrancis referred to the \"brutal acts of terrorism\" that struck the French capital this year as well as attacks in Egypt's airspace, in Beirut, Mali and Tunisia. He denounced the ongoing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine and issued consolation to Christians being persecuted for their faith in many parts of the planet.\n\"They are our martyrs of today,\" he said.\nIn an indirect reference to the Islamic State group, he said: \"May the attention of the international community be unanimously directed to ending the atrocities which in those countries, as well as in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and sub-Saharan Africa, even now reap numerous victims, cause immense suffering and do not even spare the historical and cultural patrimony of entire peoples.\"\nFrancis said he hoped the plenary indulgence he issued for this, his Holy Year of Mercy, would encourage the faithful \"to welcome God's mercy in our lives, and be merciful with our brothers to make peace grow.\"\n\"Only God's mercy can free humanity from the many forms of evil, at times monstrous evil, which selfishness spawns in our midst,\" he said.\nLibya has been in a state of lawlessness since dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown in 2011. Syria has seen a five-year war that has killed over 250,000 people and forced millions to flee the country. The surge of refugees flowing out of Syria to Europe has created a migration crisis for the entire continent.\n\"We pray to the Lord that the agreement reached in the United Nations may succeed in halting as quickly as possible the clash of arms in Syria and in remedying the extremely grave humanitarian situation of its suffering people,\" he said. \"It is likewise urgent that the agreement on Libya be supported by all, so as to overcome the grave divisions and violence afflicting the country.\"\nFrancis praised both individuals and countries that have taken in refugees fleeing \"inhuman conditions,\" saying their generosity had helped the newcomers \"build a dignified future for themselves and for their dear ones, and to be integrated in the societies which receive them.\"\n___\nFollow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield\n"}

Researchers discovered the tomb in 1996 in Saqqara, an ancient burial ground about 19 miles (30 kilometers) south of Cairo, according to a statement posted yesterday (Dec. 20) on the \nEgyptian Ministry of Antiquities' Facebook page\n.\nIn preparation for the public opening of Maia's tomb next month, the ministry organized a cleaning of the space. During this preparation, workers found a potsherd with the title \"Great one of the Harim,\" inscribed on it, Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty said in the statement. [\nIn Photos: The Life and Death of King Tut\n]\nThis inscription suggests that \"Maia wasn't just the private wet nurse of the king,\" Tutankhamun, but that she held a much higher position, Eldamaty said. Perhaps Maia was actually Meritaten (also spelled Merit Aten), King Tut's half sister, he said.\nA burial scene painted on the royal tomb at Tal Al-Amarna (also spelled Tell el-Amarna), an ancient city built by \nKing Tut's father, Akhenaten\n, shows a portrait of the family. One scene shows the burial of Meketaten, one of King Akhenaten's daughters. Within that scene, \nMeritaten\nis shown breast-feeding a baby, who is thought to be Tut, according to the statement.\n\"Maia is none other than princess Meritaten, the sister or half sister of Tutankhamun and the daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti,\" Alain Zivie, the discoverer of Maia's tomb and director of the French archaeological mission of Bubastis at Saqqara, \ntold the Agence France-Presse\n (AFP).\nMaia's tomb holds more clues about her identity, Zivie said. For instance, there are carvings of Tut and Maia within her tomb, he said.\n\"The carvings show Maia sitting on the royal throne, and he is sitting on her [lap],\" Zivie told the AFP. \"The extraordinary thing is that they are very similar. They have the same chin, the eyes, the family traits.\"\nThe new finding will help researchers piece together the life story of King Tut, who assumed the throne at about age 10 and ruled Egypt from 1332 B.C. to 1323 B.C. Earlier \ngenetic tests identified Akhenaten\n as King Tut's father, but the name of his mother remains elusive.\nThis isn't King Tut's first appearance in the media in recent weeks. The king's funerary mask went back on display at Cairo's Egyptian Museum last week after its \nbeard was reattached with beeswax\n, and archaeologists are now investigating whether previously overlooked rooms next to Tut's burial chamber contain other tombs, possibly that of \nQueen Nefertiti\n, who is thought to be King Tut's stepmother.\nFollow Laura Geggel on Twitter \n@LauraGeggel\n.

Viewing \nvideo of his slalom\n during the World Cup event in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, on Tuesday must have been quite chilling for him.\nIn a press conference after his descent \nreported by the New York Times\n, Hirscher said he had sensed something immediately behind him: \"I didn't know what it was, but I felt something.

After that, both species were listed as critically endangered, first by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2010, and next by Australia's threatened species legislation in 2011, and many scientists presumed they were extinct. [\nImage Gallery: Snakes of the World\n]\nHowever, every once in a while, researchers would hear anecdotal stories about sea snake sightings, though in different places off the western Australia coast.\nSo, a group of scientists launched an exhaustive search for the two snake species. They spent more than 60 hours scuba diving and snorkeling, and more than 25 hours with a manta tow (dragging a snorkel diver behind a small boat). They also investigated prawn trawler bycatch (trawling boats using nets to catch seafood), and spent 2 hours searching for the snakes during low-tide walks, according to the study.\nThe search was a success, yielding 16 of the \npurplish A. foliosquama\n and seven of the yellowish A. apraefrontalis snakes, the researchers said. Whenever possible, the researchers took small tissue samples from the snakes before setting them free, and then returned to the lab to verify the species with genetic analyses, according to the study.\n\"This discovery is really exciting — we get another chance to protect these two endemic western Australian sea snake species,\" study lead author Blanche D'Anastasi, a doctoral candidate at the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, \nsaid in a statement\n.\n\"But in order to succeed in protecting them, we will need to monitor populations as well as undertake research into understanding their biology and the threats they face,\" she added.\nSurprisingly, the researchers found the snakes in previously unreported habitats. They discovered A. foliosquama in the lush sea-grass beds of subtropical Shark Bay, located 1,056 miles (1,700 kilometers) south of Ashmore Reef — about the distance between New York City and Jackson, Mississippi.\n\"We had thought that this species of sea snake was only found on tropical coral reefs,\" D'Anastasi said. \"Finding them in sea-grass beds at \nShark Bay\n was a real surprise.\"\nGrant Griffin, a wildlife officer with Western Australia Parks and Wildlife, also snapped a photo of two courting A. apraefrontalis snakes in Ningaloo Reef in April 2013.\n\"We were blown away; these potentially extinct snakes were there in plain sight, living on one of Australia's natural icons, Ningaloo Reef,\" D'Anastasi said.\nDisappearing snakes\nIt's still a mystery why these two species, as well as three other sea snake species, disappeared from Ashmore Reef, D'Anastasi said.\nAustralia is a hotspot of biodiversity for sea snakes, hosting about 35 of the roughly 70 known sea snake species in the world. Sea snakes typically live in shallow water, give birth to live young and are important predators that help maintain coral reef ecosystems, the researchers said. [\nColorful Creations: See Photos of Incredible Coral\n]\n\"What is of extreme concern, however, is that it has not yet been possible to identify the processes that caused the extirpations [local extinctions] of these and other Aipysurus species on Timor Sea reefs,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\nThough many of the sea snakes were collected as trawler bycatches, the researchers weren't able to link their disappearance to such trawling.\nPerhaps other conditions, such as loss of habitat or prey; disease; climate change; or the effects of mining exploration and extraction harmed these local populations, the researchers said.\nThe study was published in the February 2016 issue of the \njournal Biological Conservation\n.\nFollow Laura Geggel on Twitter \n@LauraGeggel\n.

A month later, I'm less worried about terrorists with a medieval worldview than I am about politicians of Western democracies.\nDon't get me wrong. The November 13 attacks were barbaric, and I don't mean to minimize them or the suffering of those affected. But when it comes to harming communication, commerce, culture and civilization in general, the attacks are just a dent. The more lasting damage could be the effect those attacks have on the future of the Internet.\nI visited several of the attack sites on a cold December afternoon. Flowers are still laid in tribute around the closed doors of the \nBataclan\n theater, where the worst of the attacks took place. Somber passersby stop to light candles and read tributes to those killed. But business is ticking along at nearby pharmacies, toy stores and clothing retailers. Café Bonne Bière, another target of the terrorists, \nreopened\n earlier this month. I watched the cafe's customers, spotlighted by a beam of afternoon sun, sipping champagne a few feet away from hundreds of flower bouquets left in memorial.\nEven on the weekend of the attack, Parisians embraced the idea of continuing with life as usual as a statement of defiance. Many headed to cafes; my family took one of our customary weekly hikes in French villages and the countryside. How strange it was that walking through the forest west of Fontainebleau and looking at art galleries in Barbizon, the \nhome of painter Jean-François Millet\n 150 years ago, really did feel like an act of political solidarity.\n\"If you're in a war of culture and lifestyle with France, good...luck,\" comedian John Oliver said on a segment of HBO's \"Last Week Tonight.\"\nPolitical pressure\nBut it's the job of politicians to keep us safe, and with scores dead, the political pressure to do something is strong. After the attacks, President François Hollande declared a \nstate of emergency\n, which the French legislature then \nextended for three months\n. This includes an updated law that grants the state not only powers for warrantless searches and house arrests, but also for conducting electronic searches and blocking some websites and online communications.\nParis perseveres despite terror attacks (pictures)\nOn November 13, 130 people were killed in coordinated terrorist shooting and bombing attacks in Paris. Here, at a cafe and bar called Le Carillon still closed a month after the attacks, bullet holes are visible in the windows. Behind these, a poster says, \"Je suis Paris,\" a slogan translated as \"I am Paris\" and an expression of solidarity with a traumatized city.\nAt the Place de la République, near several of the Paris attacks, people have left flowers and candles in an impromptu memorial. Here, a man adds another candle.\nFive were killed here in an attack at the Café Bonne Bière in Paris, but the establishment is open for business again. Here, patrons sip wine and chat in the December afternoon sun across from bouquets of flowers piled in a memorial. After the attacks, Parisians went out to cafes as a gesture of defiance.\nSpray-painted on the ground at the Place de la République is a message, \"La vraie intelligence c'est faire le bien. Seul le bien vainc le mal.\" Translation: \"True intelligence is doing good. Only good overcomes evil.\"\nHardest hit in the terror attacks was the Bataclan, a theater where 89 were killed during a concert by the US band Eagles of Death Metal. The sidewalk in front of the theater is blanketed by bouquets, and hundreds more line the fence across the street along the Promenade Richard-Lenoir.\nA month after the terrorist attacks, the French police still maintain a presence at the Bataclan theater. Visitors to the site stream by, reading posters and tributes and leaving their own mementos. Police are visible in greater numbers at big tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower, too, though the increase began after January's terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo publication.\nThe Eiffel Tower was bathed in French flag colors after the terrorist attacks of November 13. At the top of the red layer is Paris' motto for more than 600 years: \"Fluctuat nec mergitur,\" Latin for \"Tossed but not sunk.\"\nThe Galeries Lafayette department store, founded in 1912, is the heart of Paris retail, with thousands of shoppers visiting to see brands like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Chanel and Lancôme. The November terrorist attacks were traumatic for Paris, but they were only a blip for a city with so much tourism and commerce.\nThe terrorist attacks were aimed at cafes that embody the Parisian lifestyle. But culture and commerce are closely paired in Paris, and neither has stopped after the attacks. This panoramic view shows Apple's flagship store in France across the street from the Paris Opera. In mid-December, Apple's store looked as heavily trafficked as ever, with dozens of shoppers checking out the gadgets for sale.\nEach year, the Galeries Lafayette erects a massive Christmas tree display in its central atrium. Here, perfume seller Christian Dior gets the central position under the tree. The flow of shoppers -- many of them tourists from other countries -- was continuous in the department store in mid-December.\nThe Galeries Lafayette builds elaborate animated displays to attract shoppers each holiday season. A month after the terror attacks, there were a couple of security guards visible nearby, but nothing else to hold back thousands of visitors checking out this year's moving robots and interactive electronic screens.\nSince the French Revolution, the country has had a motto of \"Liberté, egalité, fraternité.\" The words are carved into government buildings and statues, such as this one at the Place de la République. Liberty has been a bit bruised during a state of emergency declared after the Paris terror attacks, but for most people freedoms haven't been curtailed by a heightened police presence and stronger powers for investigation and detention.\nPeople have left flowers, candles, flags and a scarf for fans of the Paris Saint-Germain soccer team as memorials at the Bataclan theater.\nAt the Carillon bar-cafe in Paris, a small memorial honors some of those killed in the terrorist attacks.\nAt le Carillon and le Petit Cambodge, two cafes in Paris that suffered terrorist attacks November 13, flags have been strewn from balconies to streetlights.\nA woman tidies up the monument to terrorist-attack victims at the Place de la République in Paris.\nThousands of bouquets, flags and candles memorialize terrorist-attack victims at the central monument at the Place de la République in Paris.\nRoses are arranged in a bullet hole at le Carillon, a cafe attacked by terrorists in Paris.\nThe central monument at the Place de la République in Paris has become an informal memorial to victims of the November 13 terrorist attacks.\nThe first of the country's three ideals that have persisted here since the French Revolution of 1789 -- liberté, fraternité, egalité -- is taking a beating. The idea of liberty seems to be holding up better than Emma Lazarus' immigrant-friendly words at the Statue of Liberty, \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" But it is under threat.\nGovernment efforts to disrupt terrorist operations are more likely to hurt the legitimate privacy of ordinary citizens. \"\nPrivacy is a basic human need\n,\" and seeking privacy doesn't always mean we're trying to hide wicked behavior, computer security expert Bruce Schneier argued in a 2006 post that's still relevant today.\nThe risk is that attempts to bring the Internet under the government's control will backfire. Instead of hurting terrorists, they will hurt the technology that underpins today's dynamic, unfettered communication and commerce.\nAttack on encryption\nIn December, the French newspaper Le Monde \nreported\n that the French Ministry of the Interior was considering proposals to block free public Wi-Fi and use of the Tor network for anonymous Internet use. Prime Minister \nManuel Valls soon rejected the idea\n, but US political powers seem to be picking up where France left off.\nAfter the Paris attacks, \nFBI Director James Comey\n and \nCIA Director John Brennan\n renewed efforts to get Apple and Google to scrap the encryption technology that keeps communications and data files private from authorities. Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic senator from California, believes the \"\nAchilles heel in the Internet is encryption\n\" -- notwithstanding that it lets political dissidents communicate and makes e-commerce possible. Republican presidential front-runner \nDonald Trump says he can shut down the parts of \"our Internet\"\n that terrorists use.\nIn practical terms, the Internet couldn't be partially shut down even if the US still exercised the control it yielded years ago. Terrorists and criminals cannot be denied encryption because \nmany freely available programs\n enable it, even if Google and Apple were to reclaim keys over devices and Facebook were to back off from WhatsApp's secured communications.\nMore feasible are actions like Facebook and Twitter shutting down accounts at authorities' request, which doesn't require wholesale changes to the Internet itself.\nFeinstein and Trump didn't respond to requests for comment. The FBI didn't comment beyond reiterating concerns raised about \ncommunications channels \"going dark.\"\n The CIA declined to comment.\nAuthorities' anti-encryption efforts awaited an opportune moment like the Paris attacks. \"The legislative environment is very hostile today,\" Robert Litt, the top lawyer for the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, wrote in an \nAugust email\n obtained by The Washington Post. But that hostility \"could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.\"\nThe Internet is mainstream\nAs an English-speaking technology journalist living in France, the Internet is an inextricable part of my life. I'm an early adopter, though, not an anomaly. I embraced email, the Web, e-commerce, maps, translation tools, smartphones and social networks before most people, but they're all mainstream now.\nThe Paris attacks show how central the Internet is to modern life. My first alert about the November attacks came through an email from a friend in New Jersey. I \nused Facebook to tell people\n our family was safe. I stayed online until 3 a.m. following events and talking to friends and family all over the world. The attacks were almost as immediate to my friends online as they were to me. With 900 million searches, the Paris terror attacks rose to be \n2015's most-searched event on Google\n.\nThe Internet, with its global reach and unparalleled ability to connect people, is the best tool we've invented so far for learning to live with our differences. Let's build it up, not tear it down, as a tool of international communications.\nAlso from CNET:\nPhones in 2016 will be cheaper and smarter\nBest high-tech ski gear\nBest tech products of 2015\n"}

A 3,000 mAh battery should be more than capable for keeping it alive throughout the day.\nSamsung's Galaxy A9 is similar in both size and power, with a slight edge. It has a 6-inch Super AMOLED screen and a beefier 4,000 mAh battery. The A9 also sports a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, but offers an 8-megapixel one on the front. Inside is an octa-core Snapdragon processor, 3GB of RAM, and the same 32GB of storage (expandable to 128GB). There is no official pricing yet, though.\nBoth phones are feature-rich, but exclusive to China\nThe Samsung A9 fits right in with the company's other recently released phones, mixing curved glass and metal with strong specs and features like a fingerprint reader and Samsung Pay. HTC's One X9 is a bit more of a departure. It still has an all-metal body, something the company has championed over the last few years, and from the back it looks almost as much like an iPhone as the One A9.\nBut from the front, the X9 looks more like a Samsung phone than anything, with the company using a glass face and even going so far as to use capacitive buttons at the bottom. (That also provides room for the return of HTC's Boomsound speakers.) Both phones will likely stay exclusive to China; neither company has released any information about US or Europe availability.\nMore from theverge.com:\nMossberg: The next big thing didn’t show up this year\n \nI bought an iPhone because I'm not as sad as I used to be\n \nThe Force Awakens: all the unanswered questions and mysteries\n \nWhy Google and Ford could be teaming up\n \nSpaceX releases close-up photos of Falcon 9's successful launch and landing\n \nGoogle is testing a way for users to log in without a password\n \nSNL's best sketch this week never aired\n \nMoto 360 Sport review\n \nThe Verge 2015 Holiday Gift Guide\n \nThe Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino at his most sophisticated and sloppy\n \nMicrosoft Lumia 950 XL review\n"}

New genetic data prompted the agency to recognize western and central African lions as subspecies P. leo leo, and spurred their\"endangered\" classification.\n\"Subspecies\" defines groups within species that are genetically distinct but still capable of interbreeding. A 2014 proposal had prompted the FSW to grant the western and central African lions \"threatened\" status. But according to today's FSW announcement, scientific information indicated that lions in those areas were actually more closely related to Asiatic lions and that they should be identified as such — P. leo leo. [\nIn Photos: A Lion's Life\n]\nAnd because P. leo leo \npopulations are significantly smaller\n than P. leo melanochaita, the agency determined that \"endangered\" status was more appropriate for the group. Only 1,400 P. leo leo individuals remain in the wild — about 900 in 14 African groups and around 500 in India.\nP. leo melanochaita's numbers are more reassuring, with an estimated 17,000 to 19,000 animals living across southern and eastern Africa, mostly in protected areas. That may seem like a lot, but estimates of lion populations in the mid-20th century placed them at around 200,000 individuals, FWS Director Dan Ashe said today at a news briefing. Ashe went on to add that the expansion of human populations and activities will only continue to \nthreaten the lions\n and their habitats.\nEstablished in 1973, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was signed into law to conserve species and their habitats by identifying which species are most vulnerable to extinction and enforcing policies to protect them. The U.S. agencies administering the ESA are the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is primarily responsible for plants and animals on land and in freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, and the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which oversees marine wildlife.\nUnder the ESA, species are listed as \"\nendangered\n,\" which describes \"any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range,\" and \"threatened,\" identifying \"any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future.\" A 2013 list published by the FWS identified 2,054 species worldwide as endangered or threatened, of which 1,436 are native to the United States.\nIn a statement, the FWS cited decades of alarming and continuous decline in African lion populations as one of the chief reasons for the status change. Factors identified as the \nbiggest threats to lions included habitat loss\n due to agriculture, killings to prevent or retaliate against lions' preying on livestock, and inadequate management of protected areas.\nIn July 2015, the death of the \nAfrican lion \"Cecil\"\n at the hands of an American hunter sparked waves of outrage across social media channels, along with calls for stronger conservation measures to protect African lions. During today's news briefing, Ashe said that, while hunting is not responsible for the recent sharp decline of African lion populations, steps must be taken to ensure that revenue from hunting provides economic support for lion management and conservation efforts.\nBeginning in 30 days, the U.S. import of any live lion specimen, products or hunting trophies will require a permit issued by the FWS, Ashe said. During the application process, the agency will determine whether the activity in question contributed to the enhancement of the species in the wild. Tying economic gain to lion conservation, Ashe said, would also encourage local communities to engage in developing sustainable solutions for Africa's lions. Otherwise, \"people will continue to see them as a threat,\" he said, \"and not a benefit.\"\nThe ESA ruling will be added to the Federal Register on Dec. 23, 2015, and will go into effect on Jan. 22, 2016.\nFollow Mindy Weisberger on \nTwitter\n and \nGoogle+\n.

John McCain to be his running mate. Shortly after the selection, it was announced that the teenager was pregnant with her first child.\nAt the time, Sarah Palin said her daughter and the baby's father would marry. Bristol Palin and the baby's father, Levi Johnston, eventually ended the relationship.\nBristol Palin later became a paid spokeswoman advocating abstinence and warning against teenage pregnancies.

Here's a look at some models designed for kids.\nAll of them feature parental controls and can toggle back and forth between kid and adult modes, so parents can use them to check their email or post on Twitter after their little ones go to bed.\n____\nLEAPFROG EPIC ($140)\nThis is LeapFrog's first Android tablet. Like its toy-like predecessor, the LeapPad, this tablet has an educational focus. Content is based on a child's age. Various apps communicate with each other as they track a child's progress, helping to create a more customized experience. Each day, kids are presented with a new vocabulary word when they sign on. A connected stylus, familiar to LeapPad users, helps with writing practice. Web surfing is limited to a 10,000 kid-safe sites.\nOnline: http://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/products/leapfrog-epic\n____\nKURIO XTREME 2 ($130)\nSimilar to the Epic, the Extreme 2 has a sharp screen, fast processor and a decent amount of storage. It comes with games and apps, including a handful of motion games that are controlled by your child's movements as they pretend to do things like ski or swim. Kids can access the Internet, which can be filtered as much or as little as their parent desires.\nOnline: http://www.kurioworld.com/k/us/parents/products/tab/\n____\nKURIO SMART ($200)\nGeared toward older kids, this is something that they can type book reports on or do online research for a school project. It is the first kids tablet to run on Windows 10 and includes a free year of Microsoft Office. Parents can filter the Internet and set time limits on use. The device comes with a slew of games and apps, including the same motion games on the Xtreme 2. The device is a laptop whose keyboard detaches to become a tablet. When closed, the keyboard acts as a hard, protective case.\nOnline: http://www.kurioworld.com/k/us/parents/products/smart/\n____\nAMAZON FIRE KIDS EDITION ($100)\nThis is Amazon's bare-bones $50 Fire tablet packaged with a colorful protective bumper (pink or blue), a year's subscription to kids' content through Amazon's FreeTime Unlimited and free replacements for two years if the tablet breaks. FreeTime Unlimited, which normally starts at $3 per month, is what really shines. Kids have unlimited access to 10,000 kid-friendly books, videos and games. Ads and in-app purchases are disabled.\nOnline: http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Edition-Display-Wi-Fi-Kid-Proof/dp/B00YYZEQ1G\n____\nVTECH INNOTAB MAX ($100)\nYes, VTech is the company that got hacked in November, exposing personal information on more than 6 million children. Nonetheless, the Innotab Max is a decent product, particularly for younger children. The tablet folds to close, creating a hard, protective case with a handle for on-the-go use. Little kids may like this, but older children will likely be turned off by the look. Because this tablet uses Google's Android, it has access to a variety of content made for that system. But it also features content designed by VTech. However, VTech's app store remains shut because of the data breach.\nOnline: http://www.vtechkids.com/brands/brand_view/innotab_max\n____\nFUHU NABI ELEV-8 ($170)\nIts sharp screen and fast processor give it the look and feel of a premium product. And while it comes with a hefty amount of built-in games and apps, kids can get more through Nabi Pass, a $5-per-month subscription service similar to FreeTime Unlimited. But the company has run into financial problems, so its Elev-8 tablets have been tough to find.\nOnline: https://www.nabitablet.com/elev-8\n"}

A new, small study says yes.\nIn the study, 91 percent of parents with touch-screen devices, such as smartphones or tablets, reported that their toddlers were able to swipe on the devices.\nIn addition, 50 percent of parents reported that their children were able to unlock the screens, and 64 percent reported that their children actively looked for touch-screen features, according to the study.  [\nThat's Incredible! 9 Brainy Baby Abilities\n]\nThe median age of the toddlers in the study who could perform these skills was 24 months, according to the study, published today (Dec. 21) in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood.\n\"Children as young as 12 months of age are able to use [touch-screen] devices, and by 24 months have \ndeveloped an array of skills\n allowing them to interact purposefully with a touch screen,\" the researchers wrote.\nIn the study, the researchers surveyed the parents of 82 children between 1 and 3 years old in a university hospital. The parents were given questionnaires that examined how their \nchildren used touch-screen devices\n, and how often.\nEighty-two percent of the parents who participated in the study owned touch-screen devices, the researchers found. Of this group, 87 percent reported that they let their children play with the devices for a median of 15 minutes each day, according to the study.\nIn addition, 72 percent of these parents reported that their children were able to specifically identify and use touch-screen apps at a median age of 25 months, the researchers wrote. One-third of the parents reported that their children could swipe, unlock, look for features, and identify and use features by a median age of 29 months.\nThe effects of using a touch-screen device at an early age are still unknown, the researchers noted.\nIn 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics re-affirmed their guidelines that \ndiscourage the use of media in children younger than 2 years of age\n. These guidelines, however, are based on more-passive forms of media, such as television, and were written before touch screens became as widespread as they are now, the researchers wrote.\nIt's possible touch screens could offer some benefits, the researchers said.\n\"Interactive touch-screen applications offer a level of engagement not previously experienced with other forms of media and are more akin to traditional play,\" the researchers wrote in their study.\nFollow Sara G.

Now it’s \nplanning to relaunch\n by embracing its past and selling vinyl.\n“You can see a yearning and an interest to try a new format,” the company’s current owner, John Lippman, told \nThe Wall Street Journal\n. Indeed, there has been an uptick in vinyl sales — 52 percent in the first half of 2015, according to the RIAA — though they still represent only 7 percent of the music market. Ebooks also seem to have reached an equilibrium with print books rather than replacing them. However, Lippman's plan to target millennials may have trouble considering that, as the Journal points out, only a third of the demographic knows what Columbia House is.\nColumbia House began in the 1950s, as part of the Columbia Records label. Its revenue peaked in 1996 at about $1.4 billion, but its fortunes changed quickly with the advent of digital music. It abandoned music subscriptions in 2010, becoming a DVD service, then filed for bankruptcy this summer.

The new products also have better screens, speedier chips and fashionably slim bodies. They let older children do more, yet hold their hands until they're ready for unsupervised access.\nAlthough many of the tablets were originally conceived as educational toys for kids as old as middle schoolers, they've been more popular with younger children. Older kids have been apt to reject them in favor of their parents' tablet or smartphone.\nThat shift has prompted companies to focus more on preschoolers and kindergarteners, as they create super-durable products that can withstand repeated abuse and develop games and apps that teach reading and math.\nBut now, some of those companies are looking to take back some of the sales to older kids that they've lost over the years, offering premium products — most with price tags of over $100 — that look and perform less like toys and more like the ones adults use.\nLeapFrog, maker of the toy-like LeapPad, released its first Android tablet this year. And Kurio is branching out to Windows 10 and includes a full version of Microsoft Office in a new tablet-laptop combination.\nThe use of Android and Windows software, in place of the more basic, custom-made systems used in toy tablets, allows for more sophisticated apps and games and a range of content from standard app stores.\nMonica Brown, LeapFrog's vice president for product marketing, said the company aimed to \"create something that was kind of sleek and more tech forward for kids who were looking for something that felt like their parents' tablet.\"\nBut parents still want educational content and safety features that come with a tablet designed purely for kids. LeapFrog's Epic, along with the other new tablets for kids, are attempts to bridge that gap.\nThe Epic looks like a regular Android tablet, but comes with a removable bright-green bumper. It is much faster than a LeapPad and can run versions of popular Android games such as \"Fruit Ninja\" and \"Doodle Jump.\" There's access to the Internet, but it's limited to about 10,000 kid-safe websites (though parents can add others). Parents can also limit and track how much time a child spends watching videos, playing games or reading.\nLynn Schofield Clark, a professor of media studies at the University of Denver, said kids tablets are a tough sell these days.\n\"Kids are always aspirational in their ages, and they're always interested in what older kids are doing,\" Clark said, pointing to the fascination that many preteens have with smartphones as a prime example.\nMeanwhile, most parents won't spend money on kids-only gadgets unless they believe they offer significant educational benefits.\n\"If they're just looking for something to entertain their kid, then why wouldn't they just hand over their smartphone?\" she asked.\nKurio aims to answer that question with the Smart, a device that let kids do things they previously might have needed their parents' laptop for, such as typing up and saving their homework online or playing video on their TV through an HDMI cable. The Smart is a Windows 10 laptop with a detachable screen and comes with a free year of Microsoft Office.\nEric Levin, Kurio's strategic director, said kids using children's tablets are getting younger, as older kids gravitate toward adult products. Four years ago, he said, most Kurio users ranged from ages 6 to 12. Now, half of them are 3 to 5.\nAlthough older kids may be ready for adult tablets, the shift has left those 8 to 12 without age-appropriate devices, Levin says. The Smart tries to fix that.\nOther makers of kids tablets have also gone high-end this year. Fuhu bills the Nabi Elev-8 as a premium, 8-inch tablet. But the company ran into financial problems early in the holiday season, and its products have been tough to find.\nNonetheless, adult tablets remain popular with kids.\nAmazon touts its Fire tablet as something the entire family can use, eliminating the need to buy something just for the kids.\n\"While I appreciate that might have led other companies to adjust their products, we're upping our game based on what customers want in the best kid experience,\" said Aaron Bromberg, senior manager of product management for Amazon Devices.\nThe tablet's FreeTime app lets parents set up profiles for each kid, with access to only the content they approve. It also lets parents limit the amount of time spent on different kinds of content such as videos or apps. For an additional fee, Amazon's FreeTime Unlimited service offers more than 10,000 books, apps, games and videos geared toward kids ages 3 to 10.\nNonetheless, Amazon is selling a kids' edition tablet for $100. It's essentially Amazon's bare-bones $50 Fire tablet packaged with a colorful protective bumper and a year's subscription to FreeTime Unlimited.\nIt also comes with a two-year guarantee: If your kid breaks it, Amazon will replace it.\n___\nFollow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler.
