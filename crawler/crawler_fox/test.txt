{"article": "By \nIt’s that time of year to pull on the extra cozy sweater, go wide-eyed at the season’s first snowfall and perhaps start dreading all the impending family time with folks we have successfully avoided since this time last year.\nNot to sound Scrooge-like, but let’s be honest: Most everyone has a few people or situations they’d rather avoid over the holidays. It’s important for parents to remember their children can feel the same.\nAmong the uncomfortable situations are countless conversations with distant (or not) relatives who may all ask the same dull or awkward questions (how is school? how are your grades? what do you want to be when you grow up? do you have a summer job yet?). There’s the expectation to play well with cousins regardless of personalities and interests; and there’s the inevitable overload of activities, family cattle calls and sugar, exhausting everyone.\nHow is a 9-year-old to survive all this \n a gigantic meltdown?\nOne part of childhood is learning to identify and manage emotions. A bad day gets better when kids can grasp and even articulate that they’re frustrated or worried or embarrassed.\nSimply putting an accurate label on what they’re experiencing provides a great deal of comfort. Parents can help kids build this skill all year by saying, “So you are really frustrated,” when their child is stuck on a math problem. Then, when they’ve had to chat with five adults in a row, the child might be better equipped to understand that they are irritated or annoyed.\nWith all of this mind, develop a plan with your kids for what they should do if they’re upset by someone. Therapists commonly develop a safety or crisis plan with clients of all ages. It includes a list of people to call when upset, strategies to distract or calm oneself, and reminders of appropriate behaviors to try.\nEveryone could benefit from a plan like this, but perhaps with a better name. It could be the “Don’t Loose It” plan or whatever clever title your child chooses. The key to making a plan like this work is practice. Once someone is approaching meltdown mode, it is too late to say, “Remember your plan!” if they haven’t memorized it.\nIf there are particular relatives that you know are challenging for your children to deal with, talk with them about some realistic expectations for behavior during family events.\nDon’t criticize or shame your children for not liking all their relatives simply because you are worried about presenting a well-behaved kid. Talk about how Grandma loves them so much and that getting to learn about their life is a big deal for her. The goal here isn’t to instill guilt, but to help your children see the bigger picture and beyond themselves, which is not a skill that comes easy.\nPerhaps give your kiddos a few suggestions for conversation. Remind them of the great field trip they took to the zoo, or encourage them to ask older relatives what they were doing at their age.\nAnother strategy to consider is incentivizing your children to show extra good manners. The key is how to do it.\nSome parents are horrified at the thought of bribing children for good behavior. This therapist is not. A big part of childhood is developing good habits. If promising a special treat gives kids the motivation they need to power through a tough afternoon, then go for it. The internal payoff for successfully managing a difficult situation is powerful.\nWhen trying this, divide the day into manageable chunks. One idea is to that for every hour of good behavior, kids earn an extra five minutes of video games or a dollar toward something you would probably be buying for them anyway.\nIf certain relatives are excessively obnoxious, rude, or even frightening, there is no reason to subject your child to more than a few moments of pleasantries with you close at hand.\nWe all want our holidays to be warm, loving, and memorable. There is no reason they can’t be. Setting realistic expectations and planning for difficult moments doesn’t detract from the season. In fact, it goes a long way \n ensuring pleasant, happy traditions that can be looked forward to year after year.\n", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/11/dealing-with-crazy-uncle-ed-at-holiday-time/", "comments": ["Dear Parents:\n\nYou shouldn't micromanage your kids' emotions.

You can still find some on the store shelves, especially specialty and 3-way bulbs, but standard 40/60/100-watt A19s are no longer available.\nUnless you stockpiled a lifetime supply of incandescent bulbs, you're probably in the market for replacements. Maybe you've already bought a different type of bulb and aren't happy with it. That’s pretty common, by the way.\nI'm going to walk you through the options on the market, and very important aspects of buying bulbs that work well in your home.\nThere are three major alternatives to incandescent bulbs: halogen, CFL and LED. Each one has its pros and cons.\n Halogen bulbs are a more efficient version of incandescents. In many stores, they're even labeled as \"eco-incandescent.\" They eke out an improvement of 28 percent over incandescent, which puts them over the 25 percent limit needed to avoid being banned.\nSo the energy savings aren't too great, and they last only as long as standard incandescents. They also put out more heat than older incandescents, though many have an inner layer that reflects the heat back toward the filament for improved efficiency. In terms of cost, they're the cheapest alternative, and they have the traditional color temperature of incandescents. (More on the really important color temperature aspect in a minute.)\nIf you want a no-fuss replacement for your existing bulbs, this is still a good choice. But in four years, the second stage of the lighting efficiency rules is supposed to go into effect, and halogen bulbs will probably disappear as well.\n Compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs have been around for a while, and they have improved since they were introduced. You can see up to 75 percent energy savings, and they're supposed to last around 10 times longer than incandescents. Price-wise, they cost only a few dollars more than halogens.\nOne concern with CFLs is that they contain trace amounts of mercury, which makes cleaning up broken bulbs and disposing of old ones a bit more complicated. \nLike larger fluorescent lights, CFLs can take a second to turn on and a little time to warm up to full brightness. Manufacturers have improved this, but there might still be a delay. Also, like any other fluorescent lights, CFLs can flicker, which may cause eye strain.\nIf you have dimmer switches in your house, note that not all CFLs are dimmable. You'll need a CFL that specifically says it's dimmable, and even then it might not work correctly with incandescent, or \"legacy,\" dimmer switches. You might have to upgrade your switches to ones designed to work with CFL and LEDs. Manufacturers Leviton and Lutron both make UL Listed dimmers and have lists of compatible bulbs.\n Light-emitting diode (LED) technology is the newest addition to the home lighting market, though you've already seen LED lights in LCD TV and monitor backlights, car headlamps, Christmas lights, municipal lighting and other places.\nLEDs save even more energy than CFLs, and they last up to 25 times longer than halogens (at three-hours-a-day usage, they can supposedly last 20 years, \n). Of course, they can cost six times more than halogen bulbs, so it's a bit more of an investment up front. But you should see big savings down the road.\nAs with CFLs, not all LED lights are dimmable, although most new ones are. Look for bulbs that say \"dimmable\" on the packaging. However, even dimmable LEDs might not work correctly with older dimmer switches. You might have to upgrade your home's dimmer switches to ones that are designed to work with CFL and LEDs.\nWhen you bought an incandescent bulb, you knew how bright a 40-, 60- or 100-watt bulb would be – even though a watt is a unit of energy, not brightness.\nWith newer, more efficient lights, a little watt goes a long way. That means a 10-watt CFL might give you the same light as a 60-watt incandescent. Fortunately, most lighting packages will say “60-watt equivalent.”\nBut that measurement won't be around forever, and it isn't always right. You might get a 60-watt equivalent CFL but find that, due to its shape or color, it's not as bright as you were hoping.\nThat's why you should start looking at a bulb's lumens rating, which is the measure of brightness. When you buy a new bulb, try it out and make a note of the lumens. This will help you find the sweet spot for your rooms. And no matter what type of bulb you buy in the future, you’ll know the brightness will be right.\nColor temperature is something many people don't consider, but they should. It's what makes the difference between a warm homey lamp and sharp white daylight. Any bulb you buy is set to a specific color temperature, such as 2,700K (K stands for the Kelvin temperature scale).\nThe lower the number, the warmer the light. Warm light is good for area lights and bedrooms at night. For reference, a candle is around 1900K.\nThe reason many people didn't like LED lights at first was that the only available color temperature was on the high side and seemed too bright and harsh for most homes. But now you can find both LEDs and CFLs in the full color temperature range.\nSo, what color temperatures should you consider?\nThose in the 2700K to 3300K range will give you a warmer light, like a typical incandescent bulb. Many manufacturers call it \"soft white.\" That's good for bedrooms and general lighting at night.\nBulbs from 3500K to 5000K are usually called \"bright white.\" They’re not as warm, but they show more detail in the room. They’re a nice middle ground for a living room.\nAnything 5500K and higher gives an effect like white sunlight. Some manufacturers even label them \"daylight.\" They’re better for reading or work because they help you pick out text and detail. Just be aware that they will trick your brain into thinking it's daytime, which can affect your sleep schedule.\nModern lightbulbs can do much more than just brighten up a room. Lighting manufacturers have started adding special features to their bulbs, especially LED bulbs.\nFor example, Philips makes the Hue \"personal wireless lighting\" system. The Hue bulbs hook up to your Wi-Fi network so you can control your lights from a smartphone or tablet. You can put the lighting on a schedule or hook it into a full home automation setup. Other manufactures, like Cree, make connected lights that can link up with home automation systems, as well.\nPhilips also makes Hue bulbs that can display up to 16 million colors, so you can choose a color that matches your mood or time of day. It has these in standard A-19 form, or as part of units like the Hue Go, Hue iris or Hue bloom. Just know you will pay a premium for these bulbs.\nYou might also run into some security concerns. Wi-Fi connected bulbs often don't have the security they should. The original Philips Hue bulb let anyone connect to it, so a neighbor could take control of your light if he wanted. And once someone connected, there was no way to disconnect him.\nWhile Philips fixed the problem, it's still something to think about as you bring high-tech connected appliances into your home. Some manufacturers take the time to put in good security, but many don't. \n", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/12/12/3-things-to-know-before-buy-your-next-lightbulb.html", "comments": ["Most republicans hate better lighting.

Three were identicle recessed fixtures and three identicle surface fixtures. Each pair of three fixtures had the same work load.  Being an old electrician I made the experiment as equal a possible on each bulb and fixture. After one year three original bulbs are still working, two IC bulbs and one LED.  The two CFL have been replaced twice for a cost of six dollars.  The ICs were made in the USA and the CFL and LEDs in China, so that may be a issue.

{"article": "One of the most heartbreaking phrases ever uttered must be “I have no friends.”\nIt is especially heartbreaking when those words come from a child. They’re hard for both the kid to admit and for any loving parent to hear.\nYou know how special your child is. You know how much he or she has to offer others. So you wonder, why can’t her peers see this? Is it possible she is a different person out there in the world than she is at home? Is she even bringing her isolation on herself, somehow?\n“There are several categories of kids when it comes to making friends,” said Eileen Kennedy-Moore, a psychologist and co-author of “The Unwritten Rules of Friendship – Simple Strategies to Help Your Child Make Friends.”\n“There are the popular kids; they are not necessarily well-liked, but they are socially powerful. Then, there are the pretty average kids, with a solid group of friends and no real trouble relating to others.\n“Then we see a sort of ‘neglected’ group. They are more on the fringes of developed peer groups. They usually end up just fine, eventually meeting like-minded kids who share their interests. Then, we have the ‘rejected’ group – these kids are actively disliked by their peers and routinely shunned by others. This is the group we really worry about.”\nCharles Sophy, a Beverly Hills, California, psychiatrist, agreed.\n“If you are hearing from teachers, caregivers or coaches that your child is a loner on the playground, doesn’t share well, gets rejected when he or she tries to join a group and/or is aggressive, it may be something to look into,” he told WebMD.\nOne mom shared her experience on social media platform Reddit, seeking advice from other Reddit users. She wrote of her 14-year-old: “My son told me last night he’s upset because he feels he has no friends. I’ve been worried about him for a while because when school is out he spends most of his time at home, playing Minecraft.”\nAnother Reddit user responded, saying, “Your son was me twenty years ago. It is an experience I wouldn’t wish on anyone.” He added that he ended up a very happy person, with loving family and many friends. He also said, “For me, my lack of friends was because of arrogance, and a lack of social skills. I was unlikable.”\nAlthough hard to accept, it may be worth considering. Is your child exhibiting behaviors that are shutting doors on friendships?\n“Is your child somehow inviting rejection?” asked Kennedy-Moore. “Are there behaviors such as extreme temper or crying fits that are chasing other kids away? This is something it would be very helpful to know — these are the kids who need some help.”\nKennedy-Moore offered some steps to getting to the bottom of your child’s social isolation.\n“First, use empathy. This is not easy for your child. Be gentle, and always be on your kid’s side,” she said.\n“Get the facts. Talk to those who come into contact with your child regularly. Other caregivers and parents, coaches, and teachers can be extremely helpful. Get their input.”\nThen, act it out.\n“With younger kids, practice behaviors that help with making friends,” said Kennedy-Moore. “Role-playing can be very effective in showing kids what actions draw other kids closer.”\nSophy suggested looking at your own social constructs.\n“You also have to look at yourself as a parent. Do you model good behavior? Do you have friends? Do you enjoy friends and go out?” she told WebMD.\nKennedy-Moore offered a few broad grade-specific tips:\n“For an elementary school-aged child, be careful not to ask, ‘Was anybody mean to you today?’ every day,” she told LifeZette. “This only emphasizes problems. While staying tuned in, allow them the space to figure out who around them is open to friendships, and how they themselves show they are open to making a new friend. Importantly, they also learn to manage disagreements.”\nFor middle school kids, tempering your own involvement is again key.\n“Be careful not to be sucked into the drama,” she advised. “All kids are different, and you don’t want to ignore really significant problems, but many times they need someone to really listen, not to stir things up further.”\nIn high school, it’s all about being the best guide through the intense social maze that you can be.\n“Acknowledge your teen’s feelings,” Kennedy-Moore said. “This is very powerful. Suggest compromises, or reflect with your son or daughter on whether an apology is warranted.”\n“Try to get a good handle yourself on when to let them work it out — step back,” she added. “They are learning really important life skills here.”\nSelf-empowerment is important, too.\n“There is nothing wrong with encouraging your child to choose kinder friends,” said Kennedy-Moore. “And a rush to label something as bullying isn’t helpful — one-on-one conflicts are not cases of bullying.”\nWhen it comes to seeking professional help, parents must rely on their gut feelings.\n“When parents say, ‘Well, it isn’t really that bad,’ I counter with, ‘Then it probably won’t take that much to fix it,’” said Kennedy-Moore.\n“It’s healthy to receive help for social problems. Friendships matter to kids. They influence not only your child’s happiness but how they feel about themselves.\n“Friendships make the hard times easier, and the good times more fun,” she said.\n", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/11/when-your-kid-says-have-no-friends/", "comments": ["I didn't read what to say?", "Republicans never have friends.\n\nThey sit in the back of most classrooms, where they learn little.

Prosecutors said the officer used excessive force after Howell tried to empty a bag of marijuana hidden in his glove compartment.\nBut judge Patricia Harrington said in announcing her verdict that the video didn't tell the whole story of the encounter.\n\"While there's no doubt that Kyle Howell suffered an injury, the people have failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the actions of the defendant were not justified,\" she said.\nHowell's supporters rose from their seats in the courtroom as the verdict was announced, put their hands in the air and shouted, \"No justice\" as they exited.\nThe verdict followed a nonjury trial that concluded Nov. 24.\nDefense attorney William Petrillo, who had said during the trial that Howell's sudden reach for the glove compartment made the officer fear for his safety, ushered LoGiudice out of the courtroom with his hand over his client's shoulder. LoGiudice would not comment on the ruling.\n\"There can be no question that this verdict was the correct verdict,\" Petrillo said.\nHowell's attorney, Amy Marion, criticized the verdict.\n\"Justice can never be served in this country as long as prosecutions like this are permitted,\" Marion said. \"We continue our request for a federal investigation and prosecution.\"\nHowell has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, claiming he suffered a broken nose and jaw and injuries to his eye.\nLoGiudice would have faced up to seven years in prison if convicted of felony assault and one year in prison if convicted of misdemeanor assault.\nHe was charged after the video footage was obtained by Howell's lawyers.\nThe district attorney's office later dropped all charges against Howell, who prosecutors have conceded has an arrest record as an adult for petty larceny and several arrests as a juvenile.\nHowell's parents have said their son, who is black, was the victim of racial profiling and police brutality. LoGiudice is white.\n\"We are disappointed,\" Kyle's mother, Joan Howell, said after the verdict. \"You all saw the video. The video doesn't lie.\"\nLoGiudice and his partner arrested Howell on assault, resisting arrest and drug charges after he allegedly refused to comply with officers' instructions to provide identification. Police said they were forced to physically restrain Howell because he tried to dump out a bag of marijuana hidden in his glove compartment.\nThe video, which obscures the view of Howell inside the vehicle, shows LoGuidice and another officer speaking with him briefly. At one point, LoGuidice is seen walking behind the car, pivoting and returning to the passenger-side door. Both officers are then seen punching and kicking Howell inside the vehicle. No charges were filed against LoGuidice's partner, Basil Gomez.\nLoGiudice testified at the trial that he was trained to \"exceed their level of force\" if someone was resisting arrest. He said Howell, whom he had known from previous encounters in the neighborhood, was fighting back while officers attempted to restrain him.\n\"When I start to strike him, he's swinging at me with his right hand,\" LoGiudice said. He said Howell's left hand was under the passenger seat and he was ignoring orders to show his hands.\n\"I'm thinking he's grabbing a gun,\" he added.\nLoGiudice said prior encounters with Howell included a car stop when he found a BB gun under Howell's seat and another in which Howell told him he'd been arrested for robberies in the past.\n", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/11/new-york-officer-seen-punching-kicking-man-during-traffic-stop-acquitted/", "comments": [], "title": "New York officer seen punching, kicking man during traffic stop acquitted"}

{"article": "Picture this. You’re in the cereal aisle of the supermarket and your toddler starts to act up. He flails his arms, begins the tear-fest and screams to the point that customers in the frozen-food section hear him.\nWhat’s a parent to do?\nYou may tell him to hush, offer a lollipop if he stops, or yell at him and tell him his behavior is terrible. Maybe in the past, you’ve done all three. But would you yell at your young child and condemn his behavior if you knew it could cause lasting harm?\nBy the age of 5, children have a sense of self-esteem as strong as an adult’s. That’s according to a new study by the University of Washington, which explains that this important personality trait is already in place before children begin kindergarten, and it remains relatively stable across one’s lifespan.\nHelping to foster a positive self-image at an early age can lead to better self-esteem later in life. And part of helping to mold children’s self-esteem is the way parents reprimand them.\nKrystin Vecchione of Paramus, New Jersey, a mother of two sons ages 2 and 11 weeks, is worries that “everything I do will have an impact on (her older son’s) self-image and self-esteem.”\n“I try very hard not to yell at him, but sometimes I do get aggravated and yell,” said Vecchione. \nA child’s self-esteem begins to form at age 3 and parents play a crucial role in it. \n“When you yell or punish, you shift a child’s focus. His focus moves from what he’s done, to retreating inward to protect himself from the intensity of the yelling and punishing,” said Sharon Silver, the author of “Stop Reacting and Start Responding: 108 Ways to Discipline Consciously and Become the Parent You Want to Be.”\n“His retreat makes him far less able to truly hear you and do as you ask,” Silver told LifeZette.\nSo, what do you do when your child is acting out? How do you react?\nSilver advises parents to take a step back and realize the difference between reacting to and responding to a child’s bad behavior.\n“Reacting is an unconscious automatic act rooted in the need to shut down behavior,” Silver told LifeZette. “Responding is a conscious, mindful act that addresses what motivated the misbehavior in the first place, and teaches those skills as part of correcting behavior.”\nPraising is just as important in the formation of self-esteem as the way parents punish their children.\nVecchione, who holds a degree in education, realizes this and makes sure to acknowledge the good along with the bad.\n“When my son does something, or says something for the first time, I tell him how proud I am of him, and if it’s a really big deal, I get really excited, and usually — so does he,” said Vecchione.\nSilver said parents can change their approach to their children’s bad behavior in order to boost their self-esteem, even if yelling has been a common reaction in the past.\n“When you shift things you send the silent message, ‘I believe in you and your ability to get it right,’” Silver told LifeZette. “If a child gets that message far more often than messages that he’s wrong, bossy, or incapable, then things will begin to shift.”\nThe next time your child starts acting out, Silver said to take a step back. Instead of yelling for bad behavior, try asking three questions: Is what he did kind? Was it safe? Was it respectful? These questions begin the process of change and teaching without categorizing or labeling, which is much better for a child’s self-esteem than criticism.\n", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/11/dont-do-this-to-your-child-way-reprimand-could-have-long-term-effects/", "comments": ["This is why our institutions of higher learning are filled with English and Philosophy majors who are \"offended\" by anyone with an opinion that differs from theirs.

Self esteem is important, but realizing that one has self responsibility is equally important. Praise is an excellent reward, but only for acceptable behavior.

The rest of their upbringing the child understands there will be punishment if they break the rules!  This translates into how they react later on to teachers, law enforcement, and other authoritarian figures.  Failure to learn that results in the coddled teenagers and young adults we are seeing today.\n\nConsistency is also huge, as I have seen others on here comment.  Don't laugh or encourage negative behavior even if it is very cute.  It will not be cute someday.  And they will not be nearly as efficiently influenced in a positive way at that point.  Many parents have lost the battle with their teenagers way before they reached teenagerhood.\n\nParental supportiveness is very important.  Neither parent should undermine the other by speaking bad about them behind their back or admitting to the child that the other parent was wrong.  The only exception would be if the child was in grave danger from one parent or the other.  Otherwise, differences of opinion in child-rearing hopefully were discussed long beforehand, but sometimes things crop up and those should be dealt with in private.  In single parent families this luxury isn't there, and so it becomes much more of a challenge.  But sometimes extended family can help affirm the child's proper upbringing.\n\nLast, but not least, the person/people the child spends the most time with will have the most influence on their lives.
